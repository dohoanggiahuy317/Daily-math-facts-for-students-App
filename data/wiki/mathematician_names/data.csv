For the operation on topological spaces, see Wedge sum . Orientation defined by an ordered set of vectors. Reversed orientation corresponds to negating the exterior product. Geometric interpretation of grade n elements in a real exterior algebra for n = 0 (signed point), 1 (directed line segment, or vector), 2 (oriented plane element), 3 (oriented volume). The exterior product of n vectors can be visualized as any n -dimensional shape (e.g. n - parallelotope , n - ellipsoid ); with magnitude ( hypervolume ), and orientation defined by that of its ( n − 1) -dimensional boundary and on which side the interior is. [1] [2] In mathematics, the exterior algebra or Grassmann algebra of a vector space V {\displaystyle V} is an associative algebra that contains V , {\displaystyle V,} which has a product, called exterior product or wedge product and denoted with ∧ {\displaystyle \wedge } , such that v ∧ v = 0 {\displaystyle v\wedge v=0} for every vector v {\displaystyle v} in V . {\displaystyle V.} The exterior algebra is named after Hermann Grassmann , [3] and the names of the product come from the ""wedge"" symbol ∧ {\displaystyle \wedge } and the fact that the product of two elements of V {\displaystyle V} is ""outside"" V . {\displaystyle V.} The wedge product of k {\displaystyle k} vectors v 1 ∧ v 2 ∧ ⋯ ∧ v k {\displaystyle v_{1}\wedge v_{2}\wedge \dots \wedge v_{k}} is called a blade of degree k {\displaystyle k} or k {\displaystyle k} - blade . The wedge product was introduced originally as an algebraic construction used in geometry to study areas , volumes , and their higher-dimensional analogues: The magnitude of a 2 -blade v ∧ w {\displaystyle v\wedge w} is the area of the parallelogram defined by v {\displaystyle v} and w , {\displaystyle w,} and, more generally, the magnitude of a k {\displaystyle k} -blade is the (hyper)volume of the parallelotope defined by the constituent vectors. The alternating property that v ∧ v = 0 {\displaystyle v\wedge v=0} implies a skew-symmetric property that v ∧ w = − w ∧ v , {\displaystyle v\wedge w=-w\wedge v,} and more generally any blade flips sign whenever two of its constituent vectors are exchanged, corresponding to a parallelotope of opposite orientation. The full exterior algebra contains objects that are not themselves blades, but linear combinations of blades; a sum of blades of homogeneous degree k {\displaystyle k} is called a k - vector , while a more general sum of blades of arbitrary degree is called a multivector . [4] The linear span of the k {\displaystyle k} -blades is called the k {\displaystyle k} - th exterior power of V . {\displaystyle V.} The exterior algebra is the direct sum of the k {\displaystyle k} -th exterior powers of V , {\displaystyle V,} and this makes the exterior algebra a graded algebra . The exterior algebra is universal in the sense that every equation that relates elements of V {\displaystyle V} in the exterior algebra is also valid in every associative algebra that contains V {\displaystyle V} and in which the square of every element of V {\displaystyle V} is zero. The definition of the exterior algebra can be extended for spaces built from vector spaces, such as vector fields and functions whose domain is a vector space. Moreover, the field of scalars may be any field (however for fields of characteristic two, the above condition v ∧ v = 0 {\displaystyle v\wedge v=0} must be replaced with v ∧ w + w ∧ v = 0 , {\displaystyle v\wedge w+w\wedge v=0,} which is equivalent in other characteristics). More generally, the exterior algebra can be defined for modules over a commutative ring . In particular, the algebra of differential forms in k {\displaystyle k} variables is an exterior algebra over the ring of the smooth functions in k {\displaystyle k} variables. Motivating examples [ edit ] Areas in the plane [ edit ] The area of a parallelogram in terms of the determinant of the matrix of coordinates of two of its vertices. The two-dimensional Euclidean vector space R 2 {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} ^{2}} is a real vector space equipped with a basis consisting of a pair of orthogonal unit vectors e 1 = [ 1 0 ] , e 2 = [ 0 1 ] . {\displaystyle {\mathbf {e} }_{1}={\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix}},\quad {\mathbf {e} }_{2}={\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}}.} Suppose that v = [ a b ] = a e 1 + b e 2 , w = [ c d ] = c e 1 + d e 2 {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} ={\begin{bmatrix}a\\b\end{bmatrix}}=a\mathbf {e} _{1}+b\mathbf {e} _{2},\quad \mathbf {w} ={\begin{bmatrix}c\\d\end{bmatrix}}=c\mathbf {e} _{1}+d\mathbf {e} _{2}} are a pair of given vectors in ⁠ R 2 {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} ^{2}} ⁠ , written in components. There is a unique parallelogram having v {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} } and w {\displaystyle \mathbf {w} } as two of its sides. The area of this parallelogram is given by the standard determinant formula: Area = | det [ v w ] | = | det [ a c b d ] | = | a d − b c | . {\displaystyle {\text{Area}}={\Bigl |}\det {\begin{bmatrix}\mathbf {v} &\mathbf {w} \end{bmatrix}}{\Bigr |}={\Biggl |}\det {\begin{bmatrix}a&c\\b&d\end{bmatrix}}{\Biggr |}=\left|ad-bc\right|.} Consider now the exterior product of v {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} } and ⁠ w {\displaystyle \mathbf {w} } ⁠ : v ∧ w = ( a e 1 + b e 2 ) ∧ ( c e 1 + d e 2 ) = a c e 1 ∧ e 1 + a d e 1 ∧ e 2 + b c e 2 ∧ e 1 + b d e 2 ∧ e 2 = ( a d − b c ) e 1 ∧ e 2 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbf {v} \wedge \mathbf {w} &=(a\mathbf {e} _{1}+b\mathbf {e} _{2})\wedge (c\mathbf {e} _{1}+d\mathbf {e} _{2})\\&=ac\mathbf {e} _{1}\wedge \mathbf {e} _{1}+ad\mathbf {e} _{1}\wedge \mathbf {e} _{2}+bc\mathbf {e} _{2}\wedge \mathbf {e} _{1}+bd\mathbf {e} _{2}\wedge \mathbf {e} _{2}\\&=\left(ad-bc\right)\mathbf {e} _{1}\wedge \mathbf {e} _{2}\end{aligned}}} where the first step uses the distributive law for the exterior product , and the last uses the fact that the exterior product is an alternating map , and in particular e 2 ∧ e 1 = − ( e 1 ∧ e 2 ) . {\displaystyle \mathbf {e} _{2}\wedge \mathbf {e} _{1}=-(\mathbf {e} _{1}\wedge \mathbf {e} _{2}).} (The fact that the exterior product is an alternating map also forces e 1 ∧ e 1 = e 2 ∧ e 2 = 0. {\displaystyle \mathbf {e} _{1}\wedge \mathbf {e} _{1}=\mathbf {e} _{2}\wedge \mathbf {e} _{2}=0.} ) Note that the coefficient in this last expression is precisely the determinant of the matrix [ v w ] . The fact that this may be positive or negative has the intuitive meaning that v and w may be oriented in a counterclockwise or clockwise sense as the vertices of the parallelogram they define. Such an area is called the signed area of the parallelogram: the absolute value of the signed area is the ordinary area, and the sign determines its orientation. The fact that this coefficient is the signed area is not an accident. In fact, it is relatively easy to see that the exterior product should be related to the signed area if one tries to axiomatize this area as an algebraic construct. In detail, if A( v , w ) denotes the signed area of the parallelogram of which the pair of vectors v and w form two adjacent sides, then A must satisfy the following properties: A( r v , s w ) = rs A( v , w ) for any real numbers r and s , since rescaling either of the sides rescales the area by the same amount (and reversing the direction of one of the sides reverses the orientation of the parallelogram). A( v , v ) = 0 , since the area of the degenerate parallelogram determined by v (i.e., a line segment ) is zero. A( w , v ) = −A( v , w ) , since interchanging the roles of v and w reverses the orientation of the parallelogram. A( v + r w , w ) = A( v , w ) for any real number r , since adding a multiple of w to v affects neither the base nor the height of the parallelogram and consequently preserves its area. A( e 1 , e 2 ) = 1 , since the area of the unit square is one. The cross product ( blue vector) in relation to the exterior product ( light blue parallelogram). The length of the cross product is to the length of the parallel unit vector ( red ) as the size of the exterior product is to the size of the reference parallelogram ( light red ). With the exception of the last property, the exterior product of two vectors satisfies the same properties as the area. In a certain sense, the exterior product generalizes the final property by allowing the area of a parallelogram to be compared to that of any chosen parallelogram in a parallel plane (here, the one with sides e 1 and e 2 ). In other words, the exterior product provides a basis-independent formulation of area. [5] Cross and triple products [ edit ] For vectors in R 3 , the exterior algebra is closely related to the cross product and triple product . Using the standard basis { e 1 , e 2 , e 3 } , the exterior product of a pair of vectors u = u 1 e 1 + u 2 e 2 + u 3 e 3 {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} =u_{1}\mathbf {e} _{1}+u_{2}\mathbf {e} _{2}+u_{3}\mathbf {e} _{3}} and v = v 1 e 1 + v 2 e 2 + v 3 e 3 {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} =v_{1}\mathbf {e} _{1}+v_{2}\mathbf {e} _{2}+v_{3}\mathbf {e} _{3}} is u ∧ v = ( u 1 v 2 − u 2 v 1 ) ( e 1 ∧ e 2 ) + ( u 3 v 1 − u 1 v 3 ) ( e 3 ∧ e 1 ) + ( u 2 v 3 − u 3 v 2 ) ( e 2 ∧ e 3 ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} \wedge \mathbf {v} =(u_{1}v_{2}-u_{2}v_{1})(\mathbf {e} _{1}\wedge \mathbf {e} _{2})+(u_{3}v_{1}-u_{1}v_{3})(\mathbf {e} _{3}\wedge \mathbf {e} _{1})+(u_{2}v_{3}-u_{3}v_{2})(\mathbf {e} _{2}\wedge \mathbf {e} _{3})} where { e 1 ∧ e 2 , e 3 ∧ e 1 , e 2 ∧ e 3 } is the basis for the three-dimensional space ⋀ 2 ( R 3 ). The coefficients above are the same as those in the usual definition of the cross product of vectors in three dimensions, the only difference being that the exterior product is not an ordinary vector, but instead is a bivector . Bringing in a third vector w = w 1 e 1 + w 2 e 2 + w 3 e 3 , {\displaystyle \mathbf {w} =w_{1}\mathbf {e} _{1}+w_{2}\mathbf {e} _{2}+w_{3}\mathbf {e} _{3},} the exterior product of three vectors is u ∧ v ∧ w = ( u 1 v 2 w 3 + u 2 v 3 w 1 + u 3 v 1 w 2 − u 1 v 3 w 2 − u 2 v 1 w 3 − u 3 v 2 w 1 ) ( e 1 ∧ e 2 ∧ e 3 ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} \wedge \mathbf {v} \wedge \mathbf {w} =(u_{1}v_{2}w_{3}+u_{2}v_{3}w_{1}+u_{3}v_{1}w_{2}-u_{1}v_{3}w_{2}-u_{2}v_{1}w_{3}-u_{3}v_{2}w_{1})(\mathbf {e} _{1}\wedge \mathbf {e} _{2}\wedge \mathbf {e} _{3})} where e 1 ∧ e 2 ∧ e 3 is the basis vector for the one-dimensional space ⋀ 3 ( R 3 ). The scalar coefficient is the triple product of the three vectors. The cross product and triple product in three dimensions each admit both geometric and algebraic interpretations. The cross product u × v can be interpreted as a vector which is perpendicular to both u and v and whose magnitude is equal to the area of the parallelogram determined by the two vectors. It can also be interpreted as the vector consisting of the minors of the matrix with columns u and v . The triple product of u , v , and w is geometrically a (signed) volume. Algebraically, it is the determinant of the matrix with columns u , v , and w . The exterior product in three dimensions allows for similar interpretations. In fact, in the presence of a positively oriented orthonormal basis , the exterior product generalizes these notions to higher dimensions. Formal definition [ edit ] The exterior algebra ⋀ ( V ) {\displaystyle \bigwedge (V)} of a vector space V {\displaystyle V} over a field K {\displaystyle K} is defined as the quotient algebra of the tensor algebra by the two-sided ideal I {\displaystyle I} generated by all elements of the form x ⊗ x {\displaystyle x\otimes x} such that x ∈ V {\displaystyle x\in V} . [6] Symbolically, ⋀ ( V ) := T ( V ) / I . {\displaystyle \bigwedge (V):=T(V)/I.\,} The exterior product ∧ {\displaystyle \wedge } of two elements of ⋀ ( V ) {\displaystyle \bigwedge (V)} is defined by α ∧ β = α ⊗ β ( mod I ) . {\displaystyle \alpha \wedge \beta =\alpha \otimes \beta {\pmod {I}}.} Algebraic properties [ edit ] Alternating product [ edit ] The exterior product is by construction alternating on elements of ⁠ V {\displaystyle V} ⁠ , which means that x ∧ x = 0 {\displaystyle x\wedge x=0} for all x ∈ V , {\displaystyle x\in V,} by the above construction. It follows that the product is also anticommutative on elements of ⁠ V {\displaystyle V} ⁠ , for supposing that ⁠ x , y ∈ V {\displaystyle x,y\in V} ⁠ , 0 = ( x + y ) ∧ ( x + y ) = x ∧ x + x ∧ y + y ∧ x + y ∧ y = x ∧ y + y ∧ x {\displaystyle 0=(x+y)\wedge (x+y)=x\wedge x+x\wedge y+y\wedge x+y\wedge y=x\wedge y+y\wedge x} hence x ∧ y = − ( y ∧ x ) . {\displaystyle x\wedge y=-(y\wedge x).} More generally, if σ {\displaystyle \sigma } is a permutation of the integers ⁠ [ 1 , … , k ] {\displaystyle [1,\dots ,k]} ⁠ , and ⁠ x 1 {\displaystyle x_{1}} ⁠ , ⁠ x 2 {\displaystyle x_{2}} ⁠ , ..., ⁠ x k {\displaystyle x_{k}} ⁠ are elements of ⁠ V {\displaystyle V} ⁠ , it follows that x σ ( 1 ) ∧ x σ ( 2 ) ∧ ⋯ ∧ x σ ( k ) = sgn ⁡ ( σ ) x 1 ∧ x 2 ∧ ⋯ ∧ x k , {\displaystyle x_{\sigma (1)}\wedge x_{\sigma (2)}\wedge \cdots \wedge x_{\sigma (k)}=\operatorname {sgn}(\sigma )x_{1}\wedge x_{2}\wedge \cdots \wedge x_{k},} where sgn ⁡ ( σ ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {sgn}(\sigma )} is the signature of the permutation ⁠ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } ⁠ . [7] In particular, if x i = x j {\displaystyle x_{i}=x_{j}} for some ⁠ i ≠ j {\displaystyle i\neq j} ⁠ , then the following generalization of the alternating property also holds: x 1 ∧ x 2 ∧ ⋯ ∧ x k = 0. {\displaystyle x_{1}\wedge x_{2}\wedge \cdots \wedge x_{k}=0.} Together with the distributive property of the exterior product, one further generalization is that a necessary and sufficient condition for { x 1 , x 2 , … , x k } {\displaystyle \{x_{1},x_{2},\dots ,x_{k}\}} to be a linearly dependent set of vectors is that x 1 ∧ x 2 ∧ ⋯ ∧ x k = 0. {\displaystyle x_{1}\wedge x_{2}\wedge \cdots \wedge x_{k}=0.} Exterior power [ edit ] The k th exterior power of ⁠ V {\displaystyle V} ⁠ , denoted ⁠ ⋀ k ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V)} ⁠ , is the vector subspace of ⁠ ⋀ ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)} ⁠ spanned by elements of the form x 1 ∧ x 2 ∧ ⋯ ∧ x k , x i ∈ V , i = 1 , 2 , … , k . {\displaystyle x_{1}\wedge x_{2}\wedge \cdots \wedge x_{k},\quad x_{i}\in V,i=1,2,\dots ,k.} If ⁠ α ∈ ⋀ k ( V ) {\displaystyle \alpha \in {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V)} ⁠ , then α {\displaystyle \alpha } is said to be a k -vector . If, furthermore, α {\displaystyle \alpha } can be expressed as an exterior product of k {\displaystyle k} elements of ⁠ V {\displaystyle V} ⁠ , then α {\displaystyle \alpha } is said to be decomposable (or simple , by some authors; or a blade , by others). Although decomposable ⁠ k {\displaystyle k} ⁠ -vectors span ⁠ ⋀ k ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V)} ⁠ , not every element of ⋀ k ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V)} is decomposable. For example, given ⁠ R 4 {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} ^{4}} ⁠ with a basis ⁠ { e 1 , e 2 , e 3 , e 4 } {\displaystyle \{e_{1},e_{2},e_{3},e_{4}\}} ⁠ , the following 2-vector is not decomposable: α = e 1 ∧ e 2 + e 3 ∧ e 4 . {\displaystyle \alpha =e_{1}\wedge e_{2}+e_{3}\wedge e_{4}.} Basis and dimension [ edit ] If the dimension of V {\displaystyle V} is n {\displaystyle n} and { e 1 , … , e n } {\displaystyle \{e_{1},\dots ,e_{n}\}} is a basis for V {\displaystyle V} , then the set { e i 1 ∧ e i 2 ∧ ⋯ ∧ e i k | 1 ≤ i 1 < i 2 < ⋯ < i k ≤ n } {\displaystyle \{\,e_{i_{1}}\wedge e_{i_{2}}\wedge \cdots \wedge e_{i_{k}}~{\big |}~~1\leq i_{1}<i_{2}<\cdots <i_{k}\leq n\,\}} is a basis for ⁠ ⋀ k ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V)} ⁠ . The reason is the following: given any exterior product of the form v 1 ∧ ⋯ ∧ v k , {\displaystyle v_{1}\wedge \cdots \wedge v_{k},} every vector v j {\displaystyle v_{j}} can be written as a linear combination of the basis vectors ⁠ e i {\displaystyle e_{i}} ⁠ ; using the bilinearity of the exterior product, this can be expanded to a linear combination of exterior products of those basis vectors. Any exterior product in which the same basis vector appears more than once is zero; any exterior product in which the basis vectors do not appear in the proper order can be reordered, changing the sign whenever two basis vectors change places. In general, the resulting coefficients of the basis k -vectors can be computed as the minors of the matrix that describes the vectors v j {\displaystyle v_{j}} in terms of the basis ⁠ e i {\displaystyle e_{i}} ⁠ . By counting the basis elements, the dimension of ⋀ k ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V)} is equal to a binomial coefficient : dim ⁡ ⋀ k ( V ) = ( n k ) , {\displaystyle \dim {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V)={\binom {n}{k}},} where ⁠ n {\displaystyle n} ⁠ is the dimension of the vectors , and ⁠ k {\displaystyle k} ⁠ is the number of vectors in the product. The binomial coefficient produces the correct result, even for exceptional cases; in particular, ⋀ k ( V ) = { 0 } {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V)=\{0\}} for ⁠ k > n {\displaystyle k>n} ⁠ . Any element of the exterior algebra can be written as a sum of k -vectors . Hence, as a vector space the exterior algebra is a direct sum ⋀ ( V ) = ⋀ 0 ( V ) ⊕ ⋀ 1 ( V ) ⊕ ⋀ 2 ( V ) ⊕ ⋯ ⊕ ⋀ n ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)={\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!0}(V)\oplus {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!1}(V)\oplus {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!2}(V)\oplus \cdots \oplus {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!n}(V)} (where, by convention, ⁠ ⋀ 0 ( V ) = K {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!0}(V)=K} ⁠ , the field underlying ⁠ V {\displaystyle V} ⁠ , and ⁠ ⋀ 1 ( V ) = V {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!1}(V)=V} ⁠ ), and therefore its dimension is equal to the sum of the binomial coefficients, which is ⁠ 2 n {\displaystyle 2^{n}} ⁠ . Rank of a k -vector [ edit ] If ⁠ α ∈ ⋀ k ( V ) {\displaystyle \alpha \in {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V)} ⁠ , then it is possible to express α {\displaystyle \alpha } as a linear combination of decomposable k -vectors : α = α ( 1 ) + α ( 2 ) + ⋯ + α ( s ) {\displaystyle \alpha =\alpha ^{(1)}+\alpha ^{(2)}+\cdots +\alpha ^{(s)}} where each α ( i ) {\displaystyle \alpha ^{(i)}} is decomposable, say α ( i ) = α 1 ( i ) ∧ ⋯ ∧ α k ( i ) , i = 1 , 2 , … , s . {\displaystyle \alpha ^{(i)}=\alpha _{1}^{(i)}\wedge \cdots \wedge \alpha _{k}^{(i)},\quad i=1,2,\ldots ,s.} The rank of the k -vector α {\displaystyle \alpha } is the minimal number of decomposable k -vectors in such an expansion of ⁠ α {\displaystyle \alpha } ⁠ . This is similar to the notion of tensor rank . Rank is particularly important in the study of 2-vectors ( Sternberg 1964 , §III.6) ( Bryant et al. 1991 ). The rank of a 2-vector α {\displaystyle \alpha } can be identified with half the rank of the matrix of coefficients of α {\displaystyle \alpha } in a basis. Thus if e i {\displaystyle e_{i}} is a basis for ⁠ V {\displaystyle V} ⁠ , then α {\displaystyle \alpha } can be expressed uniquely as α = ∑ i , j a i j e i ∧ e j {\displaystyle \alpha =\sum _{i,j}a_{ij}e_{i}\wedge e_{j}} where a i j = − a j i {\displaystyle a_{ij}=-a_{ji}} (the matrix of coefficients is skew-symmetric ). The rank of the matrix a i j {\displaystyle a_{ij}} is therefore even, and is twice the rank of the form α {\displaystyle \alpha } . In characteristic 0, the 2-vector α {\displaystyle \alpha } has rank p {\displaystyle p} if and only if α ∧ ⋯ ∧ α ⏟ p ≠ 0 {\displaystyle {\underset {p}{\underbrace {\alpha \wedge \cdots \wedge \alpha } }}\neq 0\ } and α ∧ ⋯ ∧ α ⏟ p + 1 = 0. {\displaystyle \ {\underset {p+1}{\underbrace {\alpha \wedge \cdots \wedge \alpha } }}=0.} Graded structure [ edit ] The exterior product of a k -vector with a p -vector is a ( k + p ) {\displaystyle (k+p)} -vector, once again invoking bilinearity. As a consequence, the direct sum decomposition of the preceding section ⋀ ( V ) = ⋀ 0 ( V ) ⊕ ⋀ 1 ( V ) ⊕ ⋀ 2 ( V ) ⊕ ⋯ ⊕ ⋀ n ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)={\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!0}(V)\oplus {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!1}(V)\oplus {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!2}(V)\oplus \cdots \oplus {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!n}(V)} gives the exterior algebra the additional structure of a graded algebra , that is ⋀ k ( V ) ∧ ⋀ p ( V ) ⊂ ⋀ k + p ( V ) . {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V)\wedge {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!p}(V)\subset {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k+p}(V).} Moreover, if K is the base field, we have ⋀ 0 ( V ) = K {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!0}(V)=K} and ⋀ 1 ( V ) = V . {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!1}(V)=V.} The exterior product is graded anticommutative, meaning that if α ∈ ⋀ k ( V ) {\displaystyle \alpha \in {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V)} and ⁠ β ∈ ⋀ p ( V ) {\displaystyle \beta \in {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!p}(V)} ⁠ , then α ∧ β = ( − 1 ) k p β ∧ α . {\displaystyle \alpha \wedge \beta =(-1)^{kp}\beta \wedge \alpha .} In addition to studying the graded structure on the exterior algebra, Bourbaki (1989) studies additional graded structures on exterior algebras, such as those on the exterior algebra of a graded module (a module that already carries its own gradation). Universal property [ edit ] Let V be a vector space over the field K . Informally, multiplication in ⋀ ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)} is performed by manipulating symbols and imposing a distributive law , an associative law , and using the identity v ∧ v = 0 {\displaystyle v\wedge v=0} for v ∈ V . Formally, ⋀ ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)} is the ""most general"" algebra in which these rules hold for the multiplication, in the sense that any unital associative K -algebra containing V with alternating multiplication on V must contain a homomorphic image of ⁠ ⋀ ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)} ⁠ . In other words, the exterior algebra has the following universal property : [8] Given any unital associative K -algebra A and any K - linear map j : V → A {\displaystyle j:V\to A} such that j ( v ) j ( v ) = 0 {\displaystyle j(v)j(v)=0} for every v in V , then there exists precisely one unital algebra homomorphism f : ⋀ ( V ) → A {\displaystyle f:{\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)\to A} such that j ( v ) = f ( i ( v )) for all v in V (here i is the natural inclusion of V in ⁠ ⋀ ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)} ⁠ , see above). Universal property of the exterior algebra To construct the most general algebra that contains V and whose multiplication is alternating on V , it is natural to start with the most general associative algebra that contains V , the tensor algebra T ( V ) , and then enforce the alternating property by taking a suitable quotient . We thus take the two-sided ideal I in T ( V ) generated by all elements of the form v ⊗ v for v in V , and define ⋀ ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)} as the quotient ⋀ ( V ) = T ( V ) / I {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)=T(V)\,/\,I} (and use ∧ as the symbol for multiplication in ⁠ ⋀ ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)} ⁠ ). It is then straightforward to show that ⋀ ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)} contains V and satisfies the above universal property. As a consequence of this construction, the operation of assigning to a vector space V its exterior algebra ⋀ ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)} is a functor from the category of vector spaces to the category of algebras. Rather than defining ⋀ ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)} first and then identifying the exterior powers ⋀ k ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V)} as certain subspaces, one may alternatively define the spaces ⋀ k ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V)} first and then combine them to form the algebra ⁠ ⋀ ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)} ⁠ . This approach is often used in differential geometry and is described in the next section. Generalizations [ edit ] Given a commutative ring R {\displaystyle R} and an R {\displaystyle R} - module ⁠ M {\displaystyle M} ⁠ , we can define the exterior algebra ⋀ ( M ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }(M)} just as above, as a suitable quotient of the tensor algebra ⁠ T ( M ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {T} (M)} ⁠ . It will satisfy the analogous universal property. Many of the properties of ⋀ ( M ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }(M)} also require that M {\displaystyle M} be a projective module . Where finite dimensionality is used, the properties further require that M {\displaystyle M} be finitely generated and projective. Generalizations to the most common situations can be found in Bourbaki (1989) . Exterior algebras of vector bundles are frequently considered in geometry and topology. There are no essential differences between the algebraic properties of the exterior algebra of finite-dimensional vector bundles and those of the exterior algebra of finitely generated projective modules, by the Serre–Swan theorem . More general exterior algebras can be defined for sheaves of modules. Alternating tensor algebra [ edit ] For a field of characteristic not 2, [9] the exterior algebra of a vector space V {\displaystyle V} over K {\displaystyle K} can be canonically identified with the vector subspace of T ( V ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {T} (V)} that consists of antisymmetric tensors . For characteristic 0 (or higher than ⁠ dim ⁡ V {\displaystyle \dim V} ⁠ ), the vector space of k {\displaystyle k} -linear antisymmetric tensors is transversal to the ideal ⁠ I {\displaystyle I} ⁠ , hence, a good choice to represent the quotient. But for nonzero characteristic, the vector space of ⁠ K {\displaystyle K} ⁠ -linear antisymmetric tensors could be not transversal to the ideal (actually, for ⁠ k ≥ char ⁡ K {\displaystyle k\geq \operatorname {char} K} ⁠ , the vector space of K {\displaystyle K} -linear antisymmetric tensors is contained in I {\displaystyle I} ); nevertheless, transversal or not, a product can be defined on this space such that the resulting algebra is isomorphic to the exterior algebra: in the first case the natural choice for the product is just the quotient product (using the available projection), in the second case, this product must be slightly modified as given below (along Arnold setting), but such that the algebra stays isomorphic with the exterior algebra, i.e. the quotient of T ( V ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {T} (V)} by the ideal I {\displaystyle I} generated by elements of the form ⁠ x ⊗ x {\displaystyle x\otimes x} ⁠ . Of course, for characteristic ⁠ 0 {\displaystyle 0} ⁠ (or higher than the dimension of the vector space), one or the other definition of the produ¸ct could be used, as the two algebras are isomorphic (see V. I. Arnold or Kobayashi-Nomizu). Let T r ( V ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {T} ^{r}(V)} be the space of homogeneous tensors of degree r {\displaystyle r} . This is spanned by decomposable tensors v 1 ⊗ ⋯ ⊗ v r , v i ∈ V . {\displaystyle v_{1}\otimes \cdots \otimes v_{r},\quad v_{i}\in V.} The antisymmetrization (or sometimes the skew-symmetrization ) of a decomposable tensor is defined by A ( r ) ⁡ ( v 1 ⊗ ⋯ ⊗ v r ) = ∑ σ ∈ S r sgn ⁡ ( σ ) v σ ( 1 ) ⊗ ⋯ ⊗ v σ ( r ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {{\mathcal {A}}^{(r)}} (v_{1}\otimes \cdots \otimes v_{r})=\sum _{\sigma \in {\mathfrak {S}}_{r}}\operatorname {sgn} (\sigma )v_{\sigma (1)}\otimes \cdots \otimes v_{\sigma (r)}} and, when r ! ≠ 0 {\displaystyle r!\neq 0} (for nonzero characteristic field r ! {\displaystyle r!} might be 0): Alt ( r ) ⁡ ( v 1 ⊗ ⋯ ⊗ v r ) = 1 r ! A ( r ) ⁡ ( v 1 ⊗ ⋯ ⊗ v r ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Alt} ^{(r)}(v_{1}\otimes \cdots \otimes v_{r})={\frac {1}{r!}}\operatorname {{\mathcal {A}}^{(r)}} (v_{1}\otimes \cdots \otimes v_{r})} where the sum is taken over the symmetric group of permutations on the symbols ⁠ { 1 , … , r } {\displaystyle \{1,\dots ,r\}} ⁠ . This extends by linearity and homogeneity to an operation, also denoted by A {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}} and A l t {\displaystyle {\rm {Alt}}} , on the full tensor algebra ⁠ T ( V ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {T} (V)} ⁠ . Note that A ( r ) ⁡ A ( r ) = r ! A ( r ) . {\displaystyle \operatorname {{\mathcal {A}}^{(r)}} \operatorname {{\mathcal {A}}^{(r)}} =r!\operatorname {{\mathcal {A}}^{(r)}} .} Such that, when defined, Alt ( r ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Alt} ^{(r)}} is the projection for the exterior (quotient) algebra onto the r-homogeneous alternating tensor subspace. On the other hand, the image A ( T ( V ) ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}(\mathrm {T} (V))} is always the alternating tensor graded subspace (not yet an algebra, as product is not yet defined), denoted ⁠ A ( V ) {\displaystyle A(V)} ⁠ . This is a vector subspace of ⁠ T ( V ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {T} (V)} ⁠ , and it inherits the structure of a graded vector space from that on ⁠ T ( V ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {T} (V)} ⁠ . Moreover, the kernel of A ( r ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}^{(r)}} is precisely ⁠ I ( r ) {\displaystyle I^{(r)}} ⁠ , the homogeneous subset of the ideal ⁠ I {\displaystyle I} ⁠ , or the kernel of A {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}} is ⁠ I {\displaystyle I} ⁠ . When Alt {\displaystyle \operatorname {Alt} } is defined, A ( V ) {\displaystyle A(V)} carries an associative graded product ⊗ ^ {\displaystyle {\widehat {\otimes }}} defined by (the same as the wedge product) t ∧ s = t ⊗ ^ s = Alt ⁡ ( t ⊗ s ) . {\displaystyle t\wedge s=t~{\widehat {\otimes }}~s=\operatorname {Alt} (t\otimes s).} Assuming K {\displaystyle K} has characteristic 0, as A ( V ) {\displaystyle A(V)} is a supplement of I {\displaystyle I} in ⁠ T ( V ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {T} (V)} ⁠ , with the above given product, there is a canonical isomorphism A ( V ) ≅ ⋀ ( V ) . {\displaystyle A(V)\cong {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V).} When the characteristic of the field is nonzero, A {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}} will do what A l t {\displaystyle {\rm {Alt}}} did before, but the product cannot be defined as above. In such a case, isomorphism A ( V ) ≅ ⋀ ( V ) {\displaystyle A(V)\cong {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)} still holds, in spite of A ( V ) {\displaystyle A(V)} not being a supplement of the ideal ⁠ I {\displaystyle I} ⁠ , but then, the product should be modified as given below ( ∧ ˙ {\displaystyle {\dot {\wedge }}} product, Arnold setting). Finally, we always get ⁠ A ( V ) {\displaystyle A(V)} ⁠ isomorphic with ⁠ ⋀ ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)} ⁠ , but the product could (or should) be chosen in two ways (or only one). Actually, the product could be chosen in many ways, rescaling it on homogeneous spaces as c ( r + p ) / c ( r ) c ( p ) {\displaystyle c(r+p)/c(r)c(p)} for an arbitrary sequence c ( r ) {\displaystyle c(r)} in the field, as long as the division makes sense (this is such that the redefined product is also associative, i.e. defines an algebra on ⁠ A ( V ) {\displaystyle A(V)} ⁠ ). Also note, the interior product definition should be changed accordingly, in order to keep its skew derivation property. Index notation [ edit ] Suppose that V has finite dimension n , and that a basis e 1 , ..., e n of V is given. Then any alternating tensor t ∈ A r ( V ) ⊂ T r ( V ) can be written in index notation with the Einstein summation convention as t = t i 1 i 2 ⋯ i r e i 1 ⊗ e i 2 ⊗ ⋯ ⊗ e i r , {\displaystyle t=t^{i_{1}i_{2}\cdots i_{r}}\,{\mathbf {e} }_{i_{1}}\otimes {\mathbf {e} }_{i_{2}}\otimes \cdots \otimes {\mathbf {e} }_{i_{r}},} where t i 1 ⋅⋅⋅ i r is completely antisymmetric in its indices. The exterior product of two alternating tensors t and s of ranks r and p is given by t ⊗ ^ s = 1 ( r + p ) ! ∑ σ ∈ S r + p sgn ⁡ ( σ ) t i σ ( 1 ) ⋯ i σ ( r ) s i σ ( r + 1 ) ⋯ i σ ( r + p ) e i 1 ⊗ e i 2 ⊗ ⋯ ⊗ e i r + p . {\displaystyle t~{\widehat {\otimes }}~s={\frac {1}{(r+p)!}}\sum _{\sigma \in {\mathfrak {S}}_{r+p}}\operatorname {sgn} (\sigma )t^{i_{\sigma (1)}\cdots i_{\sigma (r)}}s^{i_{\sigma (r+1)}\cdots i_{\sigma (r+p)}}{\mathbf {e} }_{i_{1}}\otimes {\mathbf {e} }_{i_{2}}\otimes \cdots \otimes {\mathbf {e} }_{i_{r+p}}.} The components of this tensor are precisely the skew part of the components of the tensor product s ⊗ t , denoted by square brackets on the indices: ( t ⊗ ^ s ) i 1 ⋯ i r + p = t [ i 1 ⋯ i r s i r + 1 ⋯ i r + p ] . {\displaystyle (t~{\widehat {\otimes }}~s)^{i_{1}\cdots i_{r+p}}=t^{[i_{1}\cdots i_{r}}s^{i_{r+1}\cdots i_{r+p}]}.} The interior product may also be described in index notation as follows. Let t = t i 0 i 1 ⋯ i r − 1 {\displaystyle t=t^{i_{0}i_{1}\cdots i_{r-1}}} be an antisymmetric tensor of rank ⁠ r {\displaystyle r} ⁠ . Then, for α ∈ V ∗ , ⁠ ι α t {\displaystyle \iota _{\alpha }t} ⁠ is an alternating tensor of rank ⁠ r − 1 {\displaystyle r-1} ⁠ , given by ( ι α t ) i 1 ⋯ i r − 1 = r ∑ j = 0 n α j t j i 1 ⋯ i r − 1 . {\displaystyle (\iota _{\alpha }t)^{i_{1}\cdots i_{r-1}}=r\sum _{j=0}^{n}\alpha _{j}t^{ji_{1}\cdots i_{r-1}}.} where n is the dimension of V . Duality [ edit ] Alternating operators [ edit ] Given two vector spaces V and X and a natural number k , an alternating operator from V k to X is a multilinear map f : V k → X {\displaystyle f:V^{k}\to X} such that whenever v 1 , ..., v k are linearly dependent vectors in V , then f ( v 1 , … , v k ) = 0. {\displaystyle f(v_{1},\ldots ,v_{k})=0.} The map w : V k → ⋀ k ( V ) , {\displaystyle w:V^{k}\to {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V),} which associates to k {\displaystyle k} vectors from V {\displaystyle V} their exterior product, i.e. their corresponding k {\displaystyle k} -vector, is also alternating. In fact, this map is the ""most general"" alternating operator defined on V k ; {\displaystyle V^{k};} given any other alternating operator f : V k → X , {\displaystyle f:V^{k}\rightarrow X,} there exists a unique linear map ϕ : ⋀ k ( V ) → X {\displaystyle \phi :{\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V)\rightarrow X} with f = ϕ ∘ w . {\displaystyle f=\phi \circ w.} This universal property characterizes the space ⋀ k ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V)} and can serve as its definition. Alternating multilinear forms [ edit ] See also: Alternating multilinear map Geometric interpretation for the exterior product of n 1-forms ( ε , η , ω ) to obtain an n -form (""mesh"" of coordinate surfaces , here planes), [1] for n = 1, 2, 3 . The ""circulations"" show orientation . [10] [11] The above discussion specializes to the case when ⁠ X = K {\displaystyle X=K} ⁠ , the base field. In this case an alternating multilinear function f : V k → K {\displaystyle f:V^{k}\to K} is called an alternating multilinear form . The set of all alternating multilinear forms is a vector space, as the sum of two such maps, or the product of such a map with a scalar, is again alternating. By the universal property of the exterior power, the space of alternating forms of degree k {\displaystyle k} on V {\displaystyle V} is naturally isomorphic with the dual vector space ⁠ ( ⋀ k ( V ) ) ∗ {\displaystyle {\bigl (}{\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V){\bigr )}^{*}} ⁠ . If V {\displaystyle V} is finite-dimensional, then the latter is naturally isomorphic [ clarification needed ] to ⁠ ⋀ k ( V ∗ ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}\left(V^{*}\right)} ⁠ . In particular, if V {\displaystyle V} is n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional, the dimension of the space of alternating maps from V k {\displaystyle V^{k}} to K {\displaystyle K} is the binomial coefficient ⁠ ( n k ) {\displaystyle \textstyle {\binom {n}{k}}} ⁠ . Under such identification, the exterior product takes a concrete form: it produces a new anti-symmetric map from two given ones. Suppose ω : V k → K and η : V m → K are two anti-symmetric maps. As in the case of tensor products of multilinear maps, the number of variables of their exterior product is the sum of the numbers of their variables. Depending on the choice of identification of elements of exterior power with multilinear forms, the exterior product is defined as ω ∧ η = Alt ⁡ ( ω ⊗ η ) {\displaystyle \omega \wedge \eta =\operatorname {Alt} (\omega \otimes \eta )} or as ω ∧ ˙ η = ( k + m ) ! k ! m ! Alt ⁡ ( ω ⊗ η ) , {\displaystyle \omega {\dot {\wedge }}\eta ={\frac {(k+m)!}{k!\,m!}}\operatorname {Alt} (\omega \otimes \eta ),} where, if the characteristic of the base field K {\displaystyle K} is 0, the alternation Alt of a multilinear map is defined to be the average of the sign-adjusted values over all the permutations of its variables: Alt ⁡ ( ω ) ( x 1 , … , x k ) = 1 k ! ∑ σ ∈ S k sgn ⁡ ( σ ) ω ( x σ ( 1 ) , … , x σ ( k ) ) . {\displaystyle \operatorname {Alt} (\omega )(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{k})={\frac {1}{k!}}\sum _{\sigma \in S_{k}}\operatorname {sgn} (\sigma )\,\omega (x_{\sigma (1)},\ldots ,x_{\sigma (k)}).} When the field K {\displaystyle K} has finite characteristic , an equivalent version of the second expression without any factorials or any constants is well-defined: ω ∧ ˙ η ( x 1 , … , x k + m ) = ∑ σ ∈ S h k , m sgn ⁡ ( σ ) ω ( x σ ( 1 ) , … , x σ ( k ) ) η ( x σ ( k + 1 ) , … , x σ ( k + m ) ) , {\displaystyle {\omega {\dot {\wedge }}\eta (x_{1},\ldots ,x_{k+m})}=\sum _{\sigma \in \mathrm {Sh} _{k,m}}\operatorname {sgn} (\sigma )\,\omega (x_{\sigma (1)},\ldots ,x_{\sigma (k)})\,\eta (x_{\sigma (k+1)},\ldots ,x_{\sigma (k+m)}),} where here Sh k , m ⊂ S k + m is the subset of ( k , m ) shuffles : permutations σ of the set {1, 2, ..., k + m } such that σ (1) < σ (2) < ⋯ < σ ( k ) , and σ ( k + 1) < σ ( k + 2) < ... < σ ( k + m ) . As this might look very specific and fine tuned, an equivalent raw version is to sum in the above formula over permutations in left cosets of S k + m / ( S k × S m ) . Interior product [ edit ] See also: Interior product Suppose that V {\displaystyle V} is finite-dimensional. If V ∗ {\displaystyle V^{*}} denotes the dual space to the vector space ⁠ V {\displaystyle V} ⁠ , then for each ⁠ α ∈ V ∗ {\displaystyle \alpha \in V^{*}} ⁠ , it is possible to define an antiderivation on the algebra ⁠ ⋀ ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)} ⁠ , ι α : ⋀ k ( V ) → ⋀ k − 1 ( V ) . {\displaystyle \iota _{\alpha }:{\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V)\rightarrow {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k-1}(V).} This derivation is called the interior product with ⁠ α {\displaystyle \alpha } ⁠ , or sometimes the insertion operator , or contraction by ⁠ α {\displaystyle \alpha } ⁠ . Suppose that ⁠ w ∈ ⋀ k ( V ) {\displaystyle w\in {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V)} ⁠ . Then w {\displaystyle w} is a multilinear mapping of V ∗ {\displaystyle V^{*}} to ⁠ K {\displaystyle K} ⁠ , so it is defined by its values on the k -fold Cartesian product ⁠ V ∗ × V ∗ × ⋯ × V ∗ {\displaystyle V^{*}\times V^{*}\times \dots \times V^{*}} ⁠ . If u 1 , u 2 , ..., u k −1 are k − 1 {\displaystyle k-1} elements of ⁠ V ∗ {\displaystyle V^{*}} ⁠ , then define ( ι α w ) ( u 1 , u 2 , … , u k − 1 ) = w ( α , u 1 , u 2 , … , u k − 1 ) . {\displaystyle (\iota _{\alpha }w)(u_{1},u_{2},\ldots ,u_{k-1})=w(\alpha ,u_{1},u_{2},\ldots ,u_{k-1}).} Additionally, let ι α f = 0 {\displaystyle \iota _{\alpha }f=0} whenever f {\displaystyle f} is a pure scalar (i.e., belonging to ⁠ ⋀ 0 ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!0}(V)} ⁠ ). Axiomatic characterization and properties [ edit ] The interior product satisfies the following properties: For each ⁠ k {\displaystyle k} ⁠ and each ⁠ α ∈ V ∗ {\displaystyle \alpha \in V^{*}} ⁠ (where by convention Λ − 1 ( V ) = { 0 } {\displaystyle \Lambda ^{-1}(V)=\{0\}} ), ι α : ⋀ k ( V ) → ⋀ k − 1 ( V ) . {\displaystyle \iota _{\alpha }:{\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V)\rightarrow {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k-1}(V).} If v {\displaystyle v} is an element of V {\displaystyle V} ( ⁠ = ⋀ 1 ( V ) {\displaystyle ={\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!1}(V)} ⁠ ), then ⁠ ι α v = α ( v ) {\displaystyle \iota _{\alpha }v=\alpha (v)} ⁠ is the dual pairing between elements of V {\displaystyle V} and elements of ⁠ V ∗ {\displaystyle V^{*}} ⁠ . For each ⁠ α ∈ V ∗ {\displaystyle \alpha \in V^{*}} ⁠ , ι α {\displaystyle \iota _{\alpha }} is a graded derivation of degree −1: ι α ( a ∧ b ) = ( ι α a ) ∧ b + ( − 1 ) deg ⁡ a a ∧ ( ι α b ) . {\displaystyle \iota _{\alpha }(a\wedge b)=(\iota _{\alpha }a)\wedge b+(-1)^{\deg a}a\wedge (\iota _{\alpha }b).} These three properties are sufficient to characterize the interior product as well as define it in the general infinite-dimensional case. Further properties of the interior product include: ι α ∘ ι α = 0. {\displaystyle \iota _{\alpha }\circ \iota _{\alpha }=0.} ι α ∘ ι β = − ι β ∘ ι α . {\displaystyle \iota _{\alpha }\circ \iota _{\beta }=-\iota _{\beta }\circ \iota _{\alpha }.} Hodge duality [ edit ] Main article: Hodge star operator Suppose that V {\displaystyle V} has finite dimension ⁠ n {\displaystyle n} ⁠ . Then the interior product induces a canonical isomorphism of vector spaces ⋀ k ( V ∗ ) ⊗ ⋀ n ( V ) → ⋀ n − k ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V^{*})\otimes {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!n}(V)\to {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!n-k}(V)} by the recursive definition ι α ∧ β = ι β ∘ ι α . {\displaystyle \iota _{\alpha \wedge \beta }=\iota _{\beta }\circ \iota _{\alpha }.} In the geometrical setting, a non-zero element of the top exterior power ⋀ n ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!n}(V)} (which is a one-dimensional vector space) is sometimes called a volume form (or orientation form , although this term may sometimes lead to ambiguity). The name orientation form comes from the fact that a choice of preferred top element determines an orientation of the whole exterior algebra, since it is tantamount to fixing an ordered basis of the vector space. Relative to the preferred volume form ⁠ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } ⁠ , the isomorphism is given explicitly by ⋀ k ( V ∗ ) → ⋀ n − k ( V ) : α ↦ ι α σ . {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V^{*})\to {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!n-k}(V):\alpha \mapsto \iota _{\alpha }\sigma .} If, in addition to a volume form, the vector space V is equipped with an inner product identifying V {\displaystyle V} with ⁠ V ∗ {\displaystyle V^{*}} ⁠ , then the resulting isomorphism is called the Hodge star operator , which maps an element to its Hodge dual : ⋆ : ⋀ k ( V ) → ⋀ n − k ( V ) . {\displaystyle \star :{\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V)\rightarrow {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!n-k}(V).} The composition of ⋆ {\displaystyle \star } with itself maps ⋀ k ( V ) → ⋀ k ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V)\to {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V)} and is always a scalar multiple of the identity map. In most applications, the volume form is compatible with the inner product in the sense that it is an exterior product of an orthonormal basis of ⁠ V {\displaystyle V} ⁠ . In this case, ⋆ ∘ ⋆ : ⋀ k ( V ) → ⋀ k ( V ) = ( − 1 ) k ( n − k ) + q i d {\displaystyle \star \circ \star :{\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V)\to {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V)=(-1)^{k(n-k)+q}\mathrm {id} } where id is the identity mapping, and the inner product has metric signature ( p , q ) — p pluses and q minuses. Inner product [ edit ] For ⁠ V {\displaystyle V} ⁠ a finite-dimensional space, an inner product (or a pseudo-Euclidean inner product) on ⁠ V {\displaystyle V} ⁠ defines an isomorphism of V {\displaystyle V} with ⁠ V ∗ {\displaystyle V^{*}} ⁠ , and so also an isomorphism of ⋀ k ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V)} with ⁠ ( ⋀ k V ) ∗ {\displaystyle {\bigl (}{\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}V{\bigr )}^{*}} ⁠ . The pairing between these two spaces also takes the form of an inner product. On decomposable ⁠ k {\displaystyle k} ⁠ -vectors, ⟨ v 1 ∧ ⋯ ∧ v k , w 1 ∧ ⋯ ∧ w k ⟩ = det ( ⟨ v i , w j ⟩ ) , {\displaystyle \left\langle v_{1}\wedge \cdots \wedge v_{k},w_{1}\wedge \cdots \wedge w_{k}\right\rangle =\det {\bigl (}\langle v_{i},w_{j}\rangle {\bigr )},} the determinant of the matrix of inner products. In the special case v i = w i , the inner product is the square norm of the k -vector, given by the determinant of the Gramian matrix (⟨ v i , v j ⟩) . This is then extended bilinearly (or sesquilinearly in the complex case) to a non-degenerate inner product on ⋀ k ( V ) . {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V).} If e i , i = 1, 2, ..., n , form an orthonormal basis of ⁠ V {\displaystyle V} ⁠ , then the vectors of the form e i 1 ∧ ⋯ ∧ e i k , i 1 < ⋯ < i k , {\displaystyle e_{i_{1}}\wedge \cdots \wedge e_{i_{k}},\quad i_{1}<\cdots <i_{k},} constitute an orthonormal basis for ⁠ ⋀ k ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V)} ⁠ , a statement equivalent to the Cauchy–Binet formula . With respect to the inner product, exterior multiplication and the interior product are mutually adjoint. Specifically, for ⁠ v ∈ ⋀ k − 1 ( V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} \in {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k-1}(V)} ⁠ , ⁠ w ∈ ⋀ k ( V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {w} \in {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V)} ⁠ , and ⁠ x ∈ V {\displaystyle x\in V} ⁠ , ⟨ x ∧ v , w ⟩ = ⟨ v , ι x ♭ w ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle x\wedge \mathbf {v} ,\mathbf {w} \rangle =\langle \mathbf {v} ,\iota _{x^{\flat }}\mathbf {w} \rangle } where x ♭ ∈ V ∗ is the musical isomorphism , the linear functional defined by x ♭ ( y ) = ⟨ x , y ⟩ {\displaystyle x^{\flat }(y)=\langle x,y\rangle } for all ⁠ y ∈ V {\displaystyle y\in V} ⁠ . This property completely characterizes the inner product on the exterior algebra. Indeed, more generally for ⁠ v ∈ ⋀ k − l ( V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} \in {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k-l}(V)} ⁠ , ⁠ w ∈ ⋀ k ( V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {w} \in {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V)} ⁠ , and ⁠ x ∈ ⋀ l ( V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} \in {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!l}(V)} ⁠ , iteration of the above adjoint properties gives ⟨ x ∧ v , w ⟩ = ⟨ v , ι x ♭ w ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle \mathbf {x} \wedge \mathbf {v} ,\mathbf {w} \rangle =\langle \mathbf {v} ,\iota _{\mathbf {x} ^{\flat }}\mathbf {w} \rangle } where now x ♭ ∈ ⋀ l ( V ∗ ) ≃ ( ⋀ l ( V ) ) ∗ {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} ^{\flat }\in {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!l}\left(V^{*}\right)\simeq {\bigl (}{\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!l}(V){\bigr )}^{*}} is the dual ⁠ l {\displaystyle l} ⁠ -vector defined by x ♭ ( y ) = ⟨ x , y ⟩ {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} ^{\flat }(\mathbf {y} )=\langle \mathbf {x} ,\mathbf {y} \rangle } for all ⁠ y ∈ ⋀ l ( V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {y} \in {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!l}(V)} ⁠ . Bialgebra structure [ edit ] There is a correspondence between the graded dual of the graded algebra ⋀ ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)} and alternating multilinear forms on ⁠ V {\displaystyle V} ⁠ . The exterior algebra (as well as the symmetric algebra ) inherits a bialgebra structure, and, indeed, a Hopf algebra structure, from the tensor algebra . See the article on tensor algebras for a detailed treatment of the topic. The exterior product of multilinear forms defined above is dual to a coproduct defined on ⁠ ⋀ ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)} ⁠ , giving the structure of a coalgebra . The coproduct is a linear function ⁠ Δ : ⋀ ( V ) → ⋀ ( V ) ⊗ ⋀ ( V ) {\displaystyle \Delta :{\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)\to {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)\otimes {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)} ⁠ , which is given by Δ ( v ) = 1 ⊗ v + v ⊗ 1 {\displaystyle \Delta (v)=1\otimes v+v\otimes 1} on elements ⁠ v ∈ V {\displaystyle v\in V} ⁠ . The symbol 1 {\displaystyle 1} stands for the unit element of the field ⁠ K {\displaystyle K} ⁠ . Recall that ⁠ K ≃ ⋀ 0 ( V ) ⊆ ⋀ ( V ) {\displaystyle K\simeq {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!0}(V)\subseteq {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)} ⁠ , so that the above really does lie in ⁠ ⋀ ( V ) ⊗ ⋀ ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)\otimes {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)} ⁠ . This definition of the coproduct is lifted to the full space ⋀ ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)} by (linear) homomorphism. The correct form of this homomorphism is not what one might naively write, but has to be the one carefully defined in the coalgebra article. In this case, one obtains Δ ( v ∧ w ) = 1 ⊗ ( v ∧ w ) + v ⊗ w − w ⊗ v + ( v ∧ w ) ⊗ 1. {\displaystyle \Delta (v\wedge w)=1\otimes (v\wedge w)+v\otimes w-w\otimes v+(v\wedge w)\otimes 1.} Expanding this out in detail, one obtains the following expression on decomposable elements: Δ ( x 1 ∧ ⋯ ∧ x k ) = ∑ p = 0 k ∑ σ ∈ S h ( p , k − p ) sgn ⁡ ( σ ) ( x σ ( 1 ) ∧ ⋯ ∧ x σ ( p ) ) ⊗ ( x σ ( p + 1 ) ∧ ⋯ ∧ x σ ( k ) ) . {\displaystyle \Delta (x_{1}\wedge \cdots \wedge x_{k})=\sum _{p=0}^{k}\;\sum _{\sigma \in Sh(p,k-p)}\;\operatorname {sgn} (\sigma )(x_{\sigma (1)}\wedge \cdots \wedge x_{\sigma (p)})\otimes (x_{\sigma (p+1)}\wedge \cdots \wedge x_{\sigma (k)}).} where the second summation is taken over all ( p , k − p ) -shuffles . By convention, one takes that Sh( k, 0) and Sh(0, k ) equals {id: {1, ..., k } → {1, ..., k }}. It is also convenient to take the pure wedge products v σ ( 1 ) ∧ ⋯ ∧ v σ ( p ) {\displaystyle v_{\sigma (1)}\wedge \dots \wedge v_{\sigma (p)}} and v σ ( p + 1 ) ∧ ⋯ ∧ v σ ( k ) {\displaystyle v_{\sigma (p+1)}\wedge \dots \wedge v_{\sigma (k)}} to equal 1 for p = 0 and p = k , respectively (the empty product in ⋀ ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)} ). The shuffle follows directly from the first axiom of a co-algebra: the relative order of the elements x k {\displaystyle x_{k}} is preserved in the riffle shuffle: the riffle shuffle merely splits the ordered sequence into two ordered sequences, one on the left, and one on the right. Observe that the coproduct preserves the grading of the algebra. Extending to the full space ⋀ ( V ) , {\textstyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V),} one has Δ : ⋀ k ( V ) → ⨁ p = 0 k ⋀ p ( V ) ⊗ ⋀ k − p ( V ) {\displaystyle \Delta :{\textstyle \bigwedge }^{k}(V)\to \bigoplus _{p=0}^{k}{\textstyle \bigwedge }^{p}(V)\otimes {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{k-p}(V)} The tensor symbol ⊗ used in this section should be understood with some caution: it is not the same tensor symbol as the one being used in the definition of the alternating product. Intuitively, it is perhaps easiest to think it as just another, but different, tensor product: it is still (bi-)linear, as tensor products should be, but it is the product that is appropriate for the definition of a bialgebra, that is, for creating the object ⁠ ⋀ ( V ) ⊗ ⋀ ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)\otimes {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)} ⁠ . Any lingering doubt can be shaken by pondering the equalities (1 ⊗ v ) ∧ (1 ⊗ w ) = 1 ⊗ ( v ∧ w ) and ( v ⊗ 1) ∧ (1 ⊗ w ) = v ⊗ w , which follow from the definition of the coalgebra, as opposed to naive manipulations involving the tensor and wedge symbols. This distinction is developed in greater detail in the article on tensor algebras . Here, there is much less of a problem, in that the alternating product ∧ {\displaystyle \wedge } clearly corresponds to multiplication in the exterior algebra, leaving the symbol ⊗ {\displaystyle \otimes } free for use in the definition of the bialgebra. In practice, this presents no particular problem, as long as one avoids the fatal trap of replacing alternating sums of ⊗ {\displaystyle \otimes } by the wedge symbol, with one exception. One can construct an alternating product from ⁠ ⊗ {\displaystyle \otimes } ⁠ , with the understanding that it works in a different space. Immediately below, an example is given: the alternating product for the dual space can be given in terms of the coproduct. The construction of the bialgebra here parallels the construction in the tensor algebra article almost exactly, except for the need to correctly track the alternating signs for the exterior algebra. In terms of the coproduct, the exterior product on the dual space is just the graded dual of the coproduct: ( α ∧ β ) ( x 1 ∧ ⋯ ∧ x k ) = ( α ⊗ β ) ( Δ ( x 1 ∧ ⋯ ∧ x k ) ) {\displaystyle (\alpha \wedge \beta )(x_{1}\wedge \cdots \wedge x_{k})=(\alpha \otimes \beta )\left(\Delta (x_{1}\wedge \cdots \wedge x_{k})\right)} where the tensor product on the right-hand side is of multilinear linear maps (extended by zero on elements of incompatible homogeneous degree: more precisely, α ∧ β = ε ∘ ( α ⊗ β ) ∘ Δ , where ε {\displaystyle \varepsilon } is the counit, as defined presently). The counit is the homomorphism ε : ⋀ ( V ) → K {\displaystyle \varepsilon :{\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)\to K} that returns the 0-graded component of its argument. The coproduct and counit, along with the exterior product, define the structure of a bialgebra on the exterior algebra. With an antipode defined on homogeneous elements by ⁠ S ( x ) = ( − 1 ) ( deg x + 1 2 ) x {\displaystyle S(x)=(-1)^{\binom {{\text{deg}}\,x\,+1}{2}}x} ⁠ , the exterior algebra is furthermore a Hopf algebra . [12] Functoriality [ edit ] Suppose that V {\displaystyle V} and W {\displaystyle W} are a pair of vector spaces and f : V → W {\displaystyle f:V\to W} is a linear map . Then, by the universal property, there exists a unique homomorphism of graded algebras ⋀ ( f ) : ⋀ ( V ) → ⋀ ( W ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }(f):{\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)\rightarrow {\textstyle \bigwedge }(W)} such that ⋀ ( f ) | ⋀ 1 ( V ) = f : V = ⋀ 1 ( V ) → W = ⋀ 1 ( W ) . {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }(f)\left|_{{\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!1}(V)}\right.=f:V={\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!1}(V)\rightarrow W={\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!1}(W).} In particular, ⋀ ( f ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }(f)} preserves homogeneous degree. The k -graded components of ⋀ ( f ) {\textstyle \bigwedge \left(f\right)} are given on decomposable elements by ⋀ ( f ) ( x 1 ∧ ⋯ ∧ x k ) = f ( x 1 ) ∧ ⋯ ∧ f ( x k ) . {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }(f)(x_{1}\wedge \cdots \wedge x_{k})=f(x_{1})\wedge \cdots \wedge f(x_{k}).} Let ⋀ k ( f ) = ⋀ ( f ) | ⋀ k ( V ) : ⋀ k ( V ) → ⋀ k ( W ) . {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(f)={\textstyle \bigwedge }(f)\left|_{{\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V)}\right.:{\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V)\rightarrow {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(W).} The components of the transformation ⁠ ⋀ k ( f ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(f)} ⁠ relative to a basis of V {\displaystyle V} and W {\displaystyle W} is the matrix of k × k {\displaystyle k\times k} minors of ⁠ f {\displaystyle f} ⁠ . In particular, if V = W {\displaystyle V=W} and V {\displaystyle V} is of finite dimension ⁠ n {\displaystyle n} ⁠ , then ⋀ n ( f ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!n}(f)} is a mapping of a one-dimensional vector space ⋀ n ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!n}(V)} to itself, and is therefore given by a scalar: the determinant of ⁠ f {\displaystyle f} ⁠ . Exactness [ edit ] If 0 → U → V → W → 0 {\displaystyle 0\to U\to V\to W\to 0} is a short exact sequence of vector spaces, then 0 → ⋀ 1 ( U ) ∧ ⋀ ( V ) → ⋀ ( V ) → ⋀ ( W ) → 0 {\displaystyle 0\to {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!1}(U)\wedge {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)\to {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)\to {\textstyle \bigwedge }(W)\to 0} is an exact sequence of graded vector spaces, [13] as is 0 → ⋀ ( U ) → ⋀ ( V ) . {\displaystyle 0\to {\textstyle \bigwedge }(U)\to {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V).} [14] Direct sums [ edit ] In particular, the exterior algebra of a direct sum is isomorphic to the tensor product of the exterior algebras: ⋀ ( V ⊕ W ) ≅ ⋀ ( V ) ⊗ ⋀ ( W ) . {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V\oplus W)\cong {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)\otimes {\textstyle \bigwedge }(W).} This is a graded isomorphism; i.e., ⋀ k ( V ⊕ W ) ≅ ⨁ p + q = k ⋀ p ( V ) ⊗ ⋀ q ( W ) . {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V\oplus W)\cong \bigoplus _{p+q=k}{\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!p}(V)\otimes {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!q}(W).} In greater generality, for a short exact sequence of vector spaces 0 → U → f V → g W → 0 , {\textstyle 0\to U\mathrel {\overset {f}{\to }} V\mathrel {\overset {g}{\to }} W\to 0,} there is a natural filtration 0 = F 0 ⊆ F 1 ⊆ ⋯ ⊆ F k ⊆ F k + 1 = ⋀ k ( V ) {\displaystyle 0=F^{0}\subseteq F^{1}\subseteq \cdots \subseteq F^{k}\subseteq F^{k+1}={\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V)} where F p {\displaystyle F^{p}} for p ≥ 1 {\displaystyle p\geq 1} is spanned by elements of the form u 1 ∧ … ∧ u k + 1 − p ∧ v 1 ∧ … v p − 1 {\displaystyle u_{1}\wedge \ldots \wedge u_{k+1-p}\wedge v_{1}\wedge \ldots v_{p-1}} for u i ∈ U {\displaystyle u_{i}\in U} and v i ∈ V . {\displaystyle v_{i}\in V.} The corresponding quotients admit a natural isomorphism F p + 1 / F p ≅ ⋀ k − p ( U ) ⊗ ⋀ p ( W ) {\displaystyle F^{p+1}/F^{p}\cong {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k-p}(U)\otimes {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!p}(W)} given by u 1 ∧ … ∧ u k − p ∧ v 1 ∧ … ∧ v p ↦ u 1 ∧ … ∧ u k − p ⊗ g ( v 1 ) ∧ … ∧ g ( v p ) . {\displaystyle u_{1}\wedge \ldots \wedge u_{k-p}\wedge v_{1}\wedge \ldots \wedge v_{p}\mapsto u_{1}\wedge \ldots \wedge u_{k-p}\otimes g(v_{1})\wedge \ldots \wedge g(v_{p}).} In particular, if U is 1-dimensional then 0 → U ⊗ ⋀ k − 1 ( W ) → ⋀ k ( V ) → ⋀ k ( W ) → 0 {\displaystyle 0\to U\otimes {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k-1}(W)\to {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V)\to {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(W)\to 0} is exact, and if W is 1-dimensional then 0 → ⋀ k ( U ) → ⋀ k ( V ) → ⋀ k − 1 ( U ) ⊗ W → 0 {\displaystyle 0\to {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{k}(U)\to {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V)\to {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k-1}(U)\otimes W\to 0} is exact. [15] Applications [ edit ] Oriented volume in affine space [ edit ] The natural setting for (oriented) k {\displaystyle k} -dimensional volume and exterior algebra is affine space . This is also the intimate connection between exterior algebra and differential forms , as to integrate we need a 'differential' object to measure infinitesimal volume. If A {\displaystyle \mathbb {A} } is an affine space over the vector space ⁠ V {\displaystyle V} ⁠ , and a ( simplex ) collection of ordered k + 1 {\displaystyle k+1} points A 0 , A 1 , . . . , A k {\displaystyle A_{0},A_{1},...,A_{k}} , we can define its oriented k {\displaystyle k} -dimensional volume as the exterior product of vectors A 0 A 1 ∧ A 0 A 2 ∧ ⋯ ∧ A 0 A k = {\displaystyle A_{0}A_{1}\wedge A_{0}A_{2}\wedge \cdots \wedge A_{0}A_{k}={}} ( − 1 ) j A j A 0 ∧ A j A 1 ∧ A j A 2 ∧ ⋯ ∧ A j A k {\displaystyle (-1)^{j}A_{j}A_{0}\wedge A_{j}A_{1}\wedge A_{j}A_{2}\wedge \cdots \wedge A_{j}A_{k}} (using concatenation P Q {\displaystyle PQ} to mean the displacement vector from point P {\displaystyle P} to Q {\displaystyle Q} ); if the order of the points is changed, the oriented volume changes by a sign, according to the parity of the permutation. In ⁠ n {\displaystyle n} ⁠ -dimensional space, the volume of any n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional simplex is a scalar multiple of any other. The sum of the ( k − 1 ) {\displaystyle (k-1)} -dimensional oriented areas of the boundary simplexes of a ⁠ k {\displaystyle k} ⁠ -dimensional simplex is zero, as for the sum of vectors around a triangle or the oriented triangles bounding the tetrahedron in the previous section. The vector space structure on ⋀ ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }(V)} generalises addition of vectors in ⁠ V {\displaystyle V} ⁠ : we have ( u 1 + u 2 ) ∧ v = u 1 ∧ v + u 2 ∧ v {\displaystyle (u_{1}+u_{2})\wedge v=u_{1}\wedge v+u_{2}\wedge v} and similarly a k -blade v 1 ∧ ⋯ ∧ v k {\displaystyle v_{1}\wedge \dots \wedge v_{k}} is linear in each factor. Linear algebra [ edit ] In applications to linear algebra , the exterior product provides an abstract algebraic manner for describing the determinant and the minors of a matrix . For instance, it is well known that the determinant of a square matrix is equal to the volume of the parallelotope whose sides are the columns of the matrix (with a sign to track orientation). This suggests that the determinant can be defined in terms of the exterior product of the column vectors. Likewise, the k × k minors of a matrix can be defined by looking at the exterior products of column vectors chosen k at a time. These ideas can be extended not just to matrices but to linear transformations as well: the determinant of a linear transformation is the factor by which it scales the oriented volume of any given reference parallelotope. So the determinant of a linear transformation can be defined in terms of what the transformation does to the top exterior power. The action of a transformation on the lesser exterior powers gives a basis -independent way to talk about the minors of the transformation. Physics [ edit ] Main article: Electromagnetic tensor In physics, many quantities are naturally represented by alternating operators. For example, if the motion of a charged particle is described by velocity and acceleration vectors in four-dimensional spacetime, then normalization of the velocity vector requires that the electromagnetic force must be an alternating operator on the velocity. Its six degrees of freedom are identified with the electric and magnetic fields. Electromagnetic field [ edit ] In Einstein's theories of relativity , the electromagnetic field is generally given as a differential 2-form F = d A {\displaystyle F=dA} in 4-space or as the equivalent alternating tensor field F i j = A [ i , j ] = A [ i ; j ] , {\displaystyle F_{ij}=A_{[i,j]}=A_{[i;j]},} the electromagnetic tensor . Then d F = d d A = 0 {\displaystyle dF=ddA=0} or the equivalent Bianchi identity F [ i j , k ] = F [ i j ; k ] = 0. {\displaystyle F_{[ij,k]}=F_{[ij;k]}=0.} None of this requires a metric. Adding the Lorentz metric and an orientation provides the Hodge star operator ⋆ {\displaystyle \star } and thus makes it possible to define J = ⋆ d ⋆ F {\displaystyle J={\star }d{\star }F} or the equivalent tensor divergence J i = F , j i j = F ; j i j {\displaystyle J^{i}=F_{,j}^{ij}=F_{;j}^{ij}} where F i j = g i k g j l F k l . {\displaystyle F^{ij}=g^{ik}g^{jl}F_{kl}.} Linear geometry [ edit ] The decomposable k -vectors have geometric interpretations: the bivector u ∧ v {\displaystyle u\wedge v} represents the plane spanned by the vectors, ""weighted"" with a number, given by the area of the oriented parallelogram with sides u {\displaystyle u} and ⁠ v {\displaystyle v} ⁠ . Analogously, the 3-vector u ∧ v ∧ w {\displaystyle u\wedge v\wedge w} represents the spanned 3-space weighted by the volume of the oriented parallelepiped with edges ⁠ u {\displaystyle u} ⁠ , ⁠ v {\displaystyle v} ⁠ , and ⁠ w {\displaystyle w} ⁠ . Projective geometry [ edit ] Decomposable k -vectors in ⋀ k ( V ) {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V)} correspond to weighted k -dimensional linear subspaces of ⁠ V {\displaystyle V} ⁠ . In particular, the Grassmannian of k -dimensional subspaces of ⁠ V {\displaystyle V} ⁠ , denoted ⁠ Gr k ⁡ ( V ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Gr} _{k}(V)} ⁠ , can be naturally identified with an algebraic subvariety of the projective space P ( ⋀ k ( V ) ) {\textstyle \mathbf {P} {\bigl (}{\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!k}(V){\bigr )}} . This is called the Plücker embedding , and the image of the embedding can be characterized by the Plücker relations . Differential geometry [ edit ] The exterior algebra has notable applications in differential geometry , where it is used to define differential forms . [16] Differential forms are mathematical objects that evaluate the length of vectors, areas of parallelograms, and volumes of higher-dimensional bodies , so they can be integrated over curves, surfaces and higher dimensional manifolds in a way that generalizes the line integrals and surface integrals from calculus. A differential form at a point of a differentiable manifold is an alternating multilinear form on the tangent space at the point. Equivalently, a differential form of degree k is a linear functional on the k th exterior power of the tangent space. As a consequence, the exterior product of multilinear forms defines a natural exterior product for differential forms. Differential forms play a major role in diverse areas of differential geometry. An alternate approach defines differential forms in terms of germs of functions . In particular, the exterior derivative gives the exterior algebra of differential forms on a manifold the structure of a differential graded algebra . The exterior derivative commutes with pullback along smooth mappings between manifolds, and it is therefore a natural differential operator . The exterior algebra of differential forms, equipped with the exterior derivative, is a cochain complex whose cohomology is called the de Rham cohomology of the underlying manifold and plays a vital role in the algebraic topology of differentiable manifolds. Representation theory [ edit ] In representation theory , the exterior algebra is one of the two fundamental Schur functors on the category of vector spaces, the other being the symmetric algebra . Together, these constructions are used to generate the irreducible representations of the general linear group (see Fundamental representation ). Superspace [ edit ] The exterior algebra over the complex numbers is the archetypal example of a superalgebra , which plays a fundamental role in physical theories pertaining to fermions and supersymmetry . A single element of the exterior algebra is called a supernumber [17] or Grassmann number . The exterior algebra itself is then just a one-dimensional superspace : it is just the set of all of the points in the exterior algebra. The topology on this space is essentially the weak topology , the open sets being the cylinder sets . An n -dimensional superspace is just the ⁠ n {\displaystyle n} ⁠ -fold product of exterior algebras. Lie algebra homology [ edit ] Let L {\displaystyle L} be a Lie algebra over a field ⁠ K {\displaystyle K} ⁠ , then it is possible to define the structure of a chain complex on the exterior algebra of ⁠ L {\displaystyle L} ⁠ . This is a ⁠ K {\displaystyle K} ⁠ -linear mapping ∂ : ⋀ p + 1 ( L ) → ⋀ p ( L ) {\displaystyle \partial :{\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!p+1}(L)\to {\textstyle \bigwedge }^{\!p}(L)} defined on decomposable elements by ∂ ( x 1 ∧ ⋯ ∧ x p + 1 ) = 1 p + 1 ∑ j < ℓ ( − 1 ) j + ℓ + 1 [ x j , x ℓ ] ∧ x 1 ∧ ⋯ ∧ x ^ j ∧ ⋯ ∧ x ^ ℓ ∧ ⋯ ∧ x p + 1 . {\displaystyle \partial (x_{1}\wedge \cdots \wedge x_{p+1})={\frac {1}{p+1}}\sum _{j<\ell }(-1)^{j+\ell +1}[x_{j},x_{\ell }]\wedge x_{1}\wedge \cdots \wedge {\hat {x}}_{j}\wedge \cdots \wedge {\hat {x}}_{\ell }\wedge \cdots \wedge x_{p+1}.} The Jacobi identity holds if and only if ⁠ 1 {\displaystyle {1}} ⁠ , and so this is a necessary and sufficient condition for an anticommutative nonassociative algebra L {\displaystyle L} to be a Lie algebra. Moreover, in that case ⋀ ( L ) {\textstyle {\textstyle \bigwedge }(L)} is a chain complex with boundary operator ⁠ ∂ {\displaystyle \partial } ⁠ . The homology associated to this complex is the Lie algebra homology . Homological algebra [ edit ] The exterior algebra is the main ingredient in the construction of the Koszul complex , a fundamental object in homological algebra . History [ edit ] The exterior algebra was first introduced by Hermann Grassmann in 1844 under the blanket term of Ausdehnungslehre , or Theory of Extension . [18] This referred more generally to an algebraic (or axiomatic) theory of extended quantities and was one of the early precursors to the modern notion of a vector space . Saint-Venant also published similar ideas of exterior calculus for which he claimed priority over Grassmann. [19] The algebra itself was built from a set of rules, or axioms, capturing the formal aspects of Cayley and Sylvester's theory of multivectors. It was thus a calculus , much like the propositional calculus , except focused exclusively on the task of formal reasoning in geometrical terms. [20] In particular, this new development allowed for an axiomatic characterization of dimension, a property that had previously only been examined from the coordinate point of view. The import of this new theory of vectors and multivectors was lost to mid-19th-century mathematicians, [21] until being thoroughly vetted by Giuseppe Peano in 1888. Peano's work also remained somewhat obscure until the turn of the century, when the subject was unified by members of the French geometry school (notably Henri Poincaré , Élie Cartan , and Gaston Darboux ) who applied Grassmann's ideas to the calculus of differential forms . A short while later, Alfred North Whitehead , borrowing from the ideas of Peano and Grassmann, introduced his universal algebra . This then paved the way for the 20th-century developments of abstract algebra by placing the axiomatic notion of an algebraic system on a firm logical footing.

For example, G 1 ( E ) = P ( E ) {\displaystyle G_{1}(E)=\mathbb {P} (E)} is the projective bundle of E . In the other direction, a Grassmann bundle is a special case of a (partial) flag bundle . Concretely, the Grassmann bundle can be constructed as a Quot scheme . Like the usual Grassmannian, the Grassmann bundle comes with natural vector bundles on it; namely, there are universal or tautological subbundle S and universal quotient bundle Q that fit into 0 → S → p ∗ E → Q → 0 {\displaystyle 0\to S\to p^{*}E\to Q\to 0} . Specifically, if V is in the fiber p −1 ( x ), then the fiber of S over V is V itself; thus, S has rank r = d = dim( V ) and ∧ d S {\displaystyle \wedge ^{d}S} is the determinant line bundle . Now, by the universal property of a projective bundle, the injection ∧ r S → p ∗ ( ∧ r E ) {\displaystyle \wedge ^{r}S\to p^{*}(\wedge ^{r}E)} corresponds to the morphism over X : G d ( E ) → P ( ∧ r E ) {\displaystyle G_{d}(E)\to \mathbb {P} (\wedge ^{r}E)} , which is nothing but a family of Plücker embeddings . The relative tangent bundle T G d ( E )/ X of G d ( E ) is given by [1] T G d ( E ) / X = Hom ⁡ ( S , Q ) = S ∨ ⊗ Q , {\displaystyle T_{G_{d}(E)/X}=\operatorname {Hom} (S,Q)=S^{\vee }\otimes Q,} which morally is given by the second fundamental form . In the case d = 1, it is given as follows: if V is a finite-dimensional vector space, then for each line l {\displaystyle l} in V passing through the origin (a point of P ( V ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} (V)} ), there is the natural identification (see Chern class#Complex projective space for example): Hom ⁡ ( l , V / l ) = T l P ( V ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Hom} (l,V/l)=T_{l}\mathbb {P} (V)} and the above is the family-version of this identification. (The general care is a generalization of this.) In the case d = 1, the early exact sequence tensored with the dual of S = O (-1) gives: 0 → O P ( E ) → p ∗ E ⊗ O P ( E ) ( 1 ) → T P ( E ) / X → 0 {\displaystyle 0\to {\mathcal {O}}_{\mathbb {P} (E)}\to p^{*}E\otimes {\mathcal {O}}_{\mathbb {P} (E)}(1)\to T_{\mathbb {P} (E)/X}\to 0} , which is the relative version of the Euler sequence .

This name must be unique across the whole of Wikipedia, so please make it informative and easy to recognize. It's no problem to use a fairly long name. It may also include spaces, commas and most other punctuation marks. Please also note that file names are case sensitive (with the exception of the first letter). Good: ""City of London, skyline from London City Hall, Oct 2008.jpg"". Bad : ""Skyline.jpg"", ""DSC0001234.jpg"". Sorry, a few special characters and character combinations cannot be used in the filename for technical reasons. This goes especially for # < > [ ] | : { } / and ~~~ . Your filename has been modified to avoid these. Please check if it is okay now. The filename you chose seems to be very short, or overly generic. Please don't use: Titles that consist only of very generic descriptive words (e.g. ""Sunset.jpg"", ""Townhall.jpg"") Titles that consist only of a person's first or last name, when that name is likely to be shared by many others (e.g. ""John.jpg"", ""Miller.jpg"") Titles that consist of mere numbers, of the kind often produced by digital cameras (""DSC_001234"", ""IMGP0345""), or random strings like those sometimes found on the web (""30996951316264l.jpg"") Existing file . Last uploaded by Example user . A file of this name already exists on Commons! If you upload your file with this name, you will be masking the existing file and make it inaccessible. Your new file will be displayed everywhere the existing file was previously used. This should not be done, except in very rare exceptional cases. Please don't upload your file under this name, unless you seriously know what you are doing. Choose a different name for your new file instead. If you want to replace the existing file with an uncontroversial, improved version of the same work, please go to Commons and upload it there, not here on the English Wikipedia's local wiki. A file of this name already exists. If you upload your file with this name, you will be overwriting the existing file. Your new file will be displayed everywhere the existing file was previously used. Please don't do this, unless you have a good reason to: No , I don't want to overwrite the existing file. I will choose a different name for my new file instead. Yes , I want to overwrite the existing file. My file is merely a new, improved and uncontentious version of the same work. The old description page, including the source and copyright information, will still be correct for the new version and can remain the same. Yes , I want to overwrite the existing file, and I will use this wizard to add a new description and new source information for it. The previous version was my own, or else I have made sure the previous uploader(s) don't object to this replacement. Please provide a brief description of the contents of this file. This will be stored and displayed as part of the file description page. It is important that other editors are able to understand what this file is about. What does this file show? What is it a photo/diagram/recording of? It will be helpful if you also add a wikilink to the article where you want to use it. Step 3: Provide source and copyright information It is very important that you read through the following options and questions, and provide all required information truthfully and carefully. This is a free work. I can demonstrate that it is legally okay for anybody to use, in Wikipedia and elsewhere, for any purpose. Thank you for offering to upload a free work. Wikipedia loves free files. However, we would love it even more if you uploaded them on our sister project, the Wikimedia Commons . Files uploaded on Commons can be used immediately here on Wikipedia as well as on all its sister projects. Uploading files on Commons works just the same as here. Your Wikipedia account will automatically work on Commons too. Please consider uploading your file on Commons . However, if you prefer to do it here instead, you may go ahead with this form. You can also first use this form to collect the information about your file and then send it to Commons from here. Copyright status: This file is entirely my own work. I am the copyright holder.

OTRS ticket received: The license hasn't yet been forwarded, but I will do so shortly or ask the owner to send it. I haven't got the evidence right now, but I will provide some if requested to do so. Note: files without verifiable permissions may be deleted. You may be better off obtaining proof of permission first. This file is from a free published source. I took it from a website or other published source, where its author has explicitly placed it under a free license, allowing free re-use by anybody. Use this only if there is an explicit licensing statement in the source. The website must explicitly say that the image is released under a license that allows free re-use for any purpose, e.g. the Creative Commons Attribution license. You must be able to point exactly to where it says this. If the source website doesn't say so explicitly, please do not upload the file . Author/owner: Date of creation: Source: For web sources: please provide a link to the html web page where the file can be found (""http://... .html""), not a direct link to the image file itself (""http://... .jpg""). For print sources: provide full bibliographic information (author, title, publisher, year, page, etc.) The copyright owner has chosen the following license for this file: License: Other: Evidence: Provide a link to where the author explicitly says that the file is released under a free license. (if not visible on the source page itself). This work is so old its copyright has expired This is an old photograph, or a photographic reproduction of an old painting, drawing, etc. I can provide enough information about its author and provenance to prove that it is old enough for its copyright to have expired. It is now legally in the Public Domain . Original author: Please name the original author of this work. Lifetime: Specify date of death, if applicable to public domain status. In many cases, we need to be certain the author died before a certain year, in many cases before 1929. Original publication: Provide as much information as possible about the original time and place of publication of this work. For print publications: provide full bibliographic information. Date of publication: Provide date of first publication, and date of creation if different. Immediate source: State exactly where you found this file. For web sources: please provide a link to the html web page where the file can be found (""http://... .html""), not a direct link to the image file itself (""http://... .jpg""). For print sources: provide full bibliographic information (author, title, publisher, year, page, etc.) Public Domain status: This work is free of all copyrights because: It was created and first published before 1929 and is therefore in the Public Domain in the US. It was first published outside the US , and it was in the Public Domain in its country of origin by the "" URAA date "". For most countries, this means the author died 70 years before 1 January 1996, i.e. before 1926. Please look up the copyright rules for the specific country at [1] . It was first published in the US before 1989 , and its copyright expired because it was published without a copyright notice and/or without the necessary copyright registration. Please look up the exact rules at [2] . Its copyright expired for some other reason. [Please explain below]. Explanation: Please provide any evidence necessary to verify the public domain status. This file is in the Public Domain for some other reason. I can demonstrate that this work is legally in the Public Domain, i.e. nobody owns any copyrights on it. This may be for a variety of reasons, for instance because it was created by the US Federal Government, or because it is too simple to attract any copyright. Public Domain means that nobody owns any copyrights on this work. It does not mean simply that it is freely viewable somewhere on the web or that it has been widely used by others. This is not for images you simply found somewhere on the web. Most images on the web are under copyright and belong to somebody, even if you believe the owner won't care about that copyright. If it is in the public domain, you must be able to point to an actual law that makes it so. If you can't point to such a law but merely found this image somewhere, then please do not upload it. Author: Please name the original author of this work. Source: State exactly where you found this file. For web sources: please provide a link to the html web page where the file can be found (""http://... .html""), not a direct link to the image file itself (""http://... .jpg""). For print sources: provide full bibliographic information (author, title, publisher, year, page, etc.) Date of creation: Public Domain status: This work is free of all copyrights because: It was created by an agency of the US Federal Government. This does not apply to most US state and local agencies , nor to governments of other countries! It is an official governmental item, such as a flag, state emblem, banknote or postage stamp, from a country where such items are exempt from copyright according to local law. This does not apply to all countries, nor does it usually apply to all publications! (For instance, it usually doesn't apply to simple publicity photographs published on a governmental website.) Please look up the copyright rules for the specific country in question. If the country does not have an exemption rule that applies to this item, go on with the section for "" non-free copyrighted works "" below. Explanation: Add any explanation or evidence necessary to substantiate your statement above. Cite and provide a link to the relevant law if possible. It is too simple to be eligible for copyright. This typically applies only to graphics that consist solely of simple geometric shapes and/or a few letters or words, or to items such as mathematical or chemical formulae. It may apply to some very simple logos that do not contain complex pictorial elements. It never applies to photographs! It is in the Public Domain for some other reason. Explanation: This is a copyrighted, non-free work, but I believe it is Fair Use. I have read the Wikipedia rules on Non-Free Content , and I am prepared to explain how the use of this file will meet the criteria set out there.

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License (""Public License""). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions. Section 1 – Definitions. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor.

For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.

Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material . Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License. Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material . Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply. No downstream restrictions . You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

Other rights . Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme.

You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable. ShareAlike .

You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply. Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights. Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material: for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database; if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b) ; and You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights. Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability. Section 6 – Term and Termination. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a) , it reinstates: automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. Sections 1 , 5 , 6 , 7 , and 8 survive termination of this Public License. Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License. Section 8 – Interpretation. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

This wizard will guide you through a questionnaire prompting you for the appropriate copyright and sourcing information for each file. Please ensure you understand copyright and the image use policy before proceeding. Upload your own or a freely licensed file Uploads to Wikimedia Commons Upload a non-free file Uploads locally to the English Wikipedia; must comply with the non-free content criteria You do not have JavaScript enabled Sorry, in order to use this uploading script, JavaScript must be enabled. You can still use the plain Special:Upload page to upload files to the English Wikipedia without JavaScript. You are not currently logged in. Sorry, in order to use this uploading script and to upload files, you need to be logged in with your named account. Please log in and then try again. Your account has not become confirmed yet. Sorry, in order to upload files on the English Wikipedia, you need to have a confirmed account . Normally, your account will become confirmed automatically once you have made 10 edits and four days have passed since you created it. You may already be able to upload files on the Wikimedia Commons , but you can't do it on the English Wikipedia just yet. If the file you want to upload has a free license, please go to Commons and upload it there. Important note: if you don't want to wait until you are autoconfirmed, you may ask somebody else to upload a file for you at Wikipedia:Files for upload . In very rare cases an administrator may make your account confirmed manually through a request at Wikipedia:Requests for permissions/Confirmed . Step 1: Choose your file File: Choose a file from your computer. Maximum file size: 100 MB. Permitted file types: png, gif, jpg, jpeg, xcf, pdf, mid, mp3, mpeg, mpg, ogg, ogv, opus, svg, djvu, tiff, tif, oga, flac, wav, wave, webm, webp. Step 2: Describe your file Please provide a clear, descriptive name by which your file will be known on Wikipedia. This name must be unique across the whole of Wikipedia, so please make it informative and easy to recognize. It's no problem to use a fairly long name. It may also include spaces, commas and most other punctuation marks. Please also note that file names are case sensitive (with the exception of the first letter). Good: ""City of London, skyline from London City Hall, Oct 2008.jpg"". Bad : ""Skyline.jpg"", ""DSC0001234.jpg"". Sorry, a few special characters and character combinations cannot be used in the filename for technical reasons. This goes especially for # < > [ ] | : { } / and ~~~ . Your filename has been modified to avoid these. Please check if it is okay now. The filename you chose seems to be very short, or overly generic. Please don't use: Titles that consist only of very generic descriptive words (e.g. ""Sunset.jpg"", ""Townhall.jpg"") Titles that consist only of a person's first or last name, when that name is likely to be shared by many others (e.g. ""John.jpg"", ""Miller.jpg"") Titles that consist of mere numbers, of the kind often produced by digital cameras (""DSC_001234"", ""IMGP0345""), or random strings like those sometimes found on the web (""30996951316264l.jpg"") Existing file . Last uploaded by Example user . A file of this name already exists on Commons! If you upload your file with this name, you will be masking the existing file and make it inaccessible. Your new file will be displayed everywhere the existing file was previously used. This should not be done, except in very rare exceptional cases. Please don't upload your file under this name, unless you seriously know what you are doing. Choose a different name for your new file instead. If you want to replace the existing file with an uncontroversial, improved version of the same work, please go to Commons and upload it there, not here on the English Wikipedia's local wiki. A file of this name already exists. If you upload your file with this name, you will be overwriting the existing file. Your new file will be displayed everywhere the existing file was previously used. Please don't do this, unless you have a good reason to: No , I don't want to overwrite the existing file. I will choose a different name for my new file instead. Yes , I want to overwrite the existing file. My file is merely a new, improved and uncontentious version of the same work. The old description page, including the source and copyright information, will still be correct for the new version and can remain the same. Yes , I want to overwrite the existing file, and I will use this wizard to add a new description and new source information for it. The previous version was my own, or else I have made sure the previous uploader(s) don't object to this replacement. Please provide a brief description of the contents of this file. This will be stored and displayed as part of the file description page. It is important that other editors are able to understand what this file is about. What does this file show? What is it a photo/diagram/recording of? It will be helpful if you also add a wikilink to the article where you want to use it. Step 3: Provide source and copyright information It is very important that you read through the following options and questions, and provide all required information truthfully and carefully. This is a free work. I can demonstrate that it is legally okay for anybody to use, in Wikipedia and elsewhere, for any purpose. Thank you for offering to upload a free work. Wikipedia loves free files. However, we would love it even more if you uploaded them on our sister project, the Wikimedia Commons . Files uploaded on Commons can be used immediately here on Wikipedia as well as on all its sister projects. Uploading files on Commons works just the same as here. Your Wikipedia account will automatically work on Commons too. Please consider uploading your file on Commons . However, if you prefer to do it here instead, you may go ahead with this form. You can also first use this form to collect the information about your file and then send it to Commons from here. Copyright status: This file is entirely my own work. I am the copyright holder. I made this myself, from scratch, without copying or incorporating anybody else's creative work, and I am willing to release it under a free license. Please note that by ""entirely self-made"" we really mean just that. Do not use this section for any of the following: a scan or photograph you made of a painting, drawing, printed page or other item originally created by somebody else. The copyright belongs to the original creator, not to you. a screenshot or other kind of capture of a video, computer screen, TV programme or other kind of visual media. a picture you created by modifying or copying some other picture or by combining several preexisting pictures made by somebody else. a picture given to you by somebody else. a picture you found somewhere on the Internet. Editors who falsely declare such items as their ""own work"" will be blocked from editing . Please describe how and when you created this item. How? (e.g.: Where and on what kind of occasion did you take this photo? How did you make this diagram? etc.) Date (please use YYYY-MM-DD format if possible). Publication: Please indicate here if you have previously published this item elsewhere, e.g. on your own website, your Flickr or Facebook account, etc., providing a link. It is important that you place this work under a free license, which will allow everybody else to use it for any purpose, including both commercial and non-commercial purposes, and to modify it. This license will be irrevocable. This file was given to me by its owner. The copyright owner of this file has given it to me for uploading on Wikipedia. I can provide evidence that they have agreed to release it under a free license, for free use by anybody and for any purpose. Please describe who owns this work and how you got it from them. Owner/author: Date of creation: Source: Where did you get the file from? (e.g. available online; was sent to me personally …) Permission: How did you receive the permission? (e.g.: by e-mail, personally, I work for the owner …) The copyright owner has chosen the following license: License: Other: Evidence: The license statement can be found online at: The license agreement has been forwarded to Wikimedia's volunteer response team at ""permissions-en@wikimedia.org"". OTRS ticket received: The license hasn't yet been forwarded, but I will do so shortly or ask the owner to send it. I haven't got the evidence right now, but I will provide some if requested to do so. Note: files without verifiable permissions may be deleted. You may be better off obtaining proof of permission first. This file is from a free published source. I took it from a website or other published source, where its author has explicitly placed it under a free license, allowing free re-use by anybody. Use this only if there is an explicit licensing statement in the source. The website must explicitly say that the image is released under a license that allows free re-use for any purpose, e.g. the Creative Commons Attribution license. You must be able to point exactly to where it says this. If the source website doesn't say so explicitly, please do not upload the file . Author/owner: Date of creation: Source: For web sources: please provide a link to the html web page where the file can be found (""http://... .html""), not a direct link to the image file itself (""http://... .jpg""). For print sources: provide full bibliographic information (author, title, publisher, year, page, etc.) The copyright owner has chosen the following license for this file: License: Other: Evidence: Provide a link to where the author explicitly says that the file is released under a free license. (if not visible on the source page itself). This work is so old its copyright has expired This is an old photograph, or a photographic reproduction of an old painting, drawing, etc. I can provide enough information about its author and provenance to prove that it is old enough for its copyright to have expired. It is now legally in the Public Domain . Original author: Please name the original author of this work. Lifetime: Specify date of death, if applicable to public domain status. In many cases, we need to be certain the author died before a certain year, in many cases before 1929. Original publication: Provide as much information as possible about the original time and place of publication of this work. For print publications: provide full bibliographic information. Date of publication: Provide date of first publication, and date of creation if different. Immediate source: State exactly where you found this file. For web sources: please provide a link to the html web page where the file can be found (""http://... .html""), not a direct link to the image file itself (""http://... .jpg""). For print sources: provide full bibliographic information (author, title, publisher, year, page, etc.) Public Domain status: This work is free of all copyrights because: It was created and first published before 1929 and is therefore in the Public Domain in the US. It was first published outside the US , and it was in the Public Domain in its country of origin by the "" URAA date "". For most countries, this means the author died 70 years before 1 January 1996, i.e. before 1926. Please look up the copyright rules for the specific country at [1] . It was first published in the US before 1989 , and its copyright expired because it was published without a copyright notice and/or without the necessary copyright registration. Please look up the exact rules at [2] . Its copyright expired for some other reason. [Please explain below]. Explanation: Please provide any evidence necessary to verify the public domain status. This file is in the Public Domain for some other reason. I can demonstrate that this work is legally in the Public Domain, i.e. nobody owns any copyrights on it. This may be for a variety of reasons, for instance because it was created by the US Federal Government, or because it is too simple to attract any copyright. Public Domain means that nobody owns any copyrights on this work. It does not mean simply that it is freely viewable somewhere on the web or that it has been widely used by others. This is not for images you simply found somewhere on the web. Most images on the web are under copyright and belong to somebody, even if you believe the owner won't care about that copyright. If it is in the public domain, you must be able to point to an actual law that makes it so. If you can't point to such a law but merely found this image somewhere, then please do not upload it. Author: Please name the original author of this work. Source: State exactly where you found this file. For web sources: please provide a link to the html web page where the file can be found (""http://... .html""), not a direct link to the image file itself (""http://... .jpg""). For print sources: provide full bibliographic information (author, title, publisher, year, page, etc.) Date of creation: Public Domain status: This work is free of all copyrights because: It was created by an agency of the US Federal Government. This does not apply to most US state and local agencies , nor to governments of other countries! It is an official governmental item, such as a flag, state emblem, banknote or postage stamp, from a country where such items are exempt from copyright according to local law. This does not apply to all countries, nor does it usually apply to all publications! (For instance, it usually doesn't apply to simple publicity photographs published on a governmental website.) Please look up the copyright rules for the specific country in question. If the country does not have an exemption rule that applies to this item, go on with the section for "" non-free copyrighted works "" below. Explanation: Add any explanation or evidence necessary to substantiate your statement above. Cite and provide a link to the relevant law if possible. It is too simple to be eligible for copyright. This typically applies only to graphics that consist solely of simple geometric shapes and/or a few letters or words, or to items such as mathematical or chemical formulae. It may apply to some very simple logos that do not contain complex pictorial elements. It never applies to photographs! It is in the Public Domain for some other reason. Explanation: This is a copyrighted, non-free work, but I believe it is Fair Use. I have read the Wikipedia rules on Non-Free Content , and I am prepared to explain how the use of this file will meet the criteria set out there. Please remember that you will need to demonstrate that: The file will serve an important function in a particular article; ( NFCC8 ) It cannot be replaced by any other, free illustration that might yet be created; ( NFCC1 ) Its use does not negatively affect the commercial interests of its owner ( NFCC2 ) There will not be more non-free material used than necessary. ( NFCC3 ) This file will be used in the following article: Enter the name of exactly one Wikipedia article, without the [[...]] brackets and without the ""http://en.wikipedia.org/..."" URL code. It has to be an actual article, not a talkpage, template, user page, etc. If you plan to use the file in more than one article, please name only one of them here. Then, after uploading, open the image description page for editing and add your separate explanations for each additional article manually. Example – article okay. This article doesn't exist! The article Example could not be found. Please check the spelling, and make sure you enter the name of an existing article in which you will include this file. If this is an article you are only planning to write, please write it first and upload the file afterwards. This is not an actual encyclopedia article! The page Example is not in the main article namespace. Non-free files can only be used in mainspace article pages, not on a user page, talk page, template, etc. Please upload this file only if it is going to be used in an actual article. If this page is an article draft in your user space, we're sorry, but we must ask you to wait until the page is ready and has been moved into mainspace, and only upload the file after that. This is a disambiguation page! The page Example is not a real article, but a disambiguation page pointing to a number of other pages. Please check and enter the exact title of the actual target article you meant. Non-free use rationale This image is the object of discussion in an article. This is a copyrighted artwork or photograph, and the image itself is the topic of discussion in the article. The discussion is about the photograph or painting as such, as a creative work, not just about the thing or person it shows. Which of these options describes this item best? Who created this work? Author/owner: Date: Source: State exactly where you found this file. For web sources: please provide a link to the html web page where the file can be found (""http://... .html""), not a direct link to the image file itself (""http://... .jpg""). For print sources: provide full bibliographic information (author, title, publisher, year, page, etc.) Usage: The article as a whole is dedicated specifically to a discussion of this particular photograph/painting. (It is not just about the person or thing shown in the picture.) There is a substantial amount of encyclopedic discussion of this particular photograph/painting ( not just about the person or thing shown in it) in this article. The illustration is specifically needed to support the following point: If neither of these two statements applies, then please do not upload this image. This section is not for images used merely to illustrate an article about a person or thing, showing what that person or thing look like. This is a depiction of a copyrighted three-dimensional work or building , which is the object of discussion in an article. This is a photograph or other kind of depiction of a copyrighted, three-dimensional creative work, such as a statue or work of architecture. The article contains a discussion of that work which requires illustration. The photograph as such is free, or was provided by the creator of the sculpture. Which of these options describes this item best? First describe who created the original work depicted: Creator: Date: Usage: The article as a whole is dedicated specifically to this work. There is a substantial amount of encyclopedic discussion of this work in this article. The illustration is specifically needed to support the following point: Now describe who created the image : Author: Date: Source: State exactly where you found this file. For web sources: please provide a link to the html web page where the file can be found (""http://... .html""), not a direct link to the image file itself (""http://... .jpg""). For print sources: provide full bibliographic information (author, title, publisher, year, page, etc.) Image status The image was created and published by the same author who also holds the rights to the original object, and no alternative depiction could be suitably created. The author of the image has released the photographic work under a free license, or it is in the public domain: Name the license or describe the public domain status, adding any necessary evidence to make the licensing status verifiable. This is an excerpt from a copyrighted work . This is an excerpt from a copyrighted work, e.g. a screenshot from a movie or TV programme, a panel from a comic, or a sound sample from a song. Its presence is needed to support a piece of explicit critical discussion in an article related to that work or its creator(s). Which of these options describes this item best? Author: (author / copyright owner of the original work) Date of creation: Source: (where exactly did you get this file from?) Please explain what exactly in the article it is that you want to illustrate with this. Typically, the illustration must be used to support some specific issue of discussion in the article. Please be concrete and specific. Don't just copy boilerplate statements from elsewhere. State clearly, in your own words, what this particular file will be doing in this particular article. If necessary, please explain why this purpose cannot be achieved through text alone. This is the official cover art of a work. This is the cover or dustjacket of a book, the cover of a CD or video, the official release poster of a movie, or a comparable item. It will be included as that work's primary means of visual identification, at the top of the article about the book, movie, etc. in question. Note: If you plan to use it for any other purpose than this, please tick the box for ""other non-free work"" below. Which of these options describes this item best? Author: (author / copyright owner of the original work) Date of publication: Source: (where exactly did you get this file from?) This image will be shown as a primary means of visual identification at the top of the article dedicated to the work in question. A standard fair use rationale will be added that matches this type of use. If you plan to use the file for any purpose other than this, please do not use this section, but the one labelled ""other type of non-free work"" below. This is a logo of an organization , company, brand, etc. This is an official logo of an entity that is the subject of a Wikipedia article.

This is a historical portrait of a person no longer alive. This is a historical photograph or other depiction of a person who is no longer alive. It will be used as the primary means of visual identification of that person in the article about them. Deceased since: (This type of file can typically only be used with people who are no longer alive.) Author: (Who made this image?) Original publication: (Where, when and how was this image first published?) Date of publication: Source: (Where exactly did you get this file from?) This image will be shown as a primary means of visual identification at the top of the article dedicated to the person in question. A standard fair use rationale will be added that matches this type of use. If you plan to use the file for any purpose other than this, please do not use this section, but the one labelled ""other type of non-free work"" below. Please explain why a free alternative to this image cannot be found. For subjects who died recently: have you made a reasonable effort to find people who might possess photographs of this person and might be willing to release one? For subjects who lived in the early-to-mid 20th century: have you considered if there might be an older photograph that has fallen in the public domain? Please explain why you are confident that our use of the file will not harm any commercial opportunities of its owner. We will typically not use a file if its owner has a potential commercial interest in its use, and if our use of it would compete with its original market role. This is some other kind of non-free work that I believe is legitimate Fair Use. This is a copyrighted work whose use does not fall into any of the classes above. I have read the Wikipedia rules on Non-free content , and I will explain how this file meets all of the criteria set out there. Which of these options describes this item best? Author: (Who made this image?) Original publication: (Where, when and how was this image first published?) Date of publication: Source: (Where exactly did you get this file from?) Please explain what exact purpose this file will serve in the article. Please be concrete and specific. Don't just copy boilerplate statements from elsewhere. State clearly, in your own words, what this particular file will be doing in this particular article. Your explanation must make it clear why the article would be significantly worse off without this file. Please explain why this purpose could not be served by text alone. Please explain why this purpose could not be served with an alternative, free illustration that could yet be found or created. For a file to be deemed replaceable, it is not necessary that a suitable replacement already exists. Even if it is merely possible that a replacement could be created, we will not use the non-free file. Please explain why you are confident that our use of the file will not harm any commercial opportunities of its owner. We will typically not use a file if its owner has a potential commercial interest in its use, and if our use of it would compete with its original market role. Remember that the use of non-free files must be minimal. This can mean several things: Don't use more files per article/topic than necessary Don't use the same file in more articles than necessary Don't use larger excerpts of a single work than necessary Don't use images of higher resolution than necessary In view of this, please explain how the use of this file will be minimal.

Its dimension is ⁠ 1 / 2 ⁠ n ( n + 1) (where the dimension of V is 2n ). It may be identified with the homogeneous space U( n )/O( n ) , where U( n ) is the unitary group and O( n ) the orthogonal group . Following Vladimir Arnold it is denoted by Λ( n ). The Lagrangian Grassmannian is a submanifold of the ordinary Grassmannian of V . A complex Lagrangian Grassmannian is the complex homogeneous manifold of Lagrangian subspaces of a complex symplectic vector space V of dimension 2 n . It may be identified with the homogeneous space of complex dimension ⁠ 1 / 2 ⁠ n ( n + 1) Sp( n )/U( n ) , where Sp( n ) is the compact symplectic group . As a homogeneous space [ edit ] To see that the Lagrangian Grassmannian Λ( n ) can be identified with U( n )/O( n ) , note that C n {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{n}} is a 2 n -dimensional real vector space, with the imaginary part of its usual inner product making it into a symplectic vector space. The Lagrangian subspaces of C n {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{n}} are then the real subspaces L ⊆ C n {\displaystyle L\subseteq \mathbb {C} ^{n}} of real dimension n on which the imaginary part of the inner product vanishes. An example is R n ⊆ C n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}\subseteq \mathbb {C} ^{n}} . The unitary group U( n ) acts transitively on the set of these subspaces, and the stabilizer of R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} is the orthogonal group O ( n ) ⊆ U ( n ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {O} (n)\subseteq \mathrm {U} (n)} . It follows from the theory of homogeneous spaces that Λ( n ) is isomorphic to U( n )/O( n ) as a homogeneous space of U( n ) . Topology [ edit ] The stable topology of the Lagrangian Grassmannian and complex Lagrangian Grassmannian is completely understood, as these spaces appear in the Bott periodicity theorem : Ω ( S p / U ) ≃ U / O {\displaystyle \Omega (\mathrm {Sp} /\mathrm {U} )\simeq \mathrm {U} /\mathrm {O} } , and Ω ( U / O ) ≃ Z × B O {\displaystyle \Omega (\mathrm {U} /\mathrm {O} )\simeq \mathbb {Z} \times \mathrm {BO} } – they are thus exactly the homotopy groups of the stable orthogonal group , up to a shift in indexing (dimension). In particular, the fundamental group of U / O {\displaystyle U/O} is infinite cyclic . Its first homology group is therefore also infinite cyclic, as is its first cohomology group , with a distinguished generator given by the square of the determinant of a unitary matrix , as a mapping to the unit circle . Arnold showed that this leads to a description of the Maslov index , introduced by V. P. Maslov . For a Lagrangian submanifold M of V , in fact, there is a mapping M → Λ ( n ) {\displaystyle M\to \Lambda (n)} which classifies its tangent space at each point (cf. Gauss map ). The Maslov index is the pullback via this mapping, in H 1 ( M , Z ) {\displaystyle H^{1}(M,\mathbb {Z} )} of the distinguished generator of H 1 ( Λ ( n ) , Z ) {\displaystyle H^{1}(\Lambda (n),\mathbb {Z} )} . Maslov index [ edit ] A path of symplectomorphisms of a symplectic vector space may be assigned a Maslov index , named after V. P. Maslov ; it will be an integer if the path is a loop, and a half-integer in general. If this path arises from trivializing the symplectic vector bundle over a periodic orbit of a Hamiltonian vector field on a symplectic manifold or the Reeb vector field on a contact manifold , it is known as the Conley–Zehnder index . It computes the spectral flow of the Cauchy–Riemann -type operators that arise in Floer homology . [1] It appeared originally in the study of the WKB approximation and appears frequently in the study of quantization , quantum chaos trace formulas, and in symplectic geometry and topology. It can be described as above in terms of a Maslov index for linear Lagrangian submanifolds. References [ edit ] ^ Wendl, Chris. ""Lectures on Symplectic Field Theory"". arXiv : 1612.01009 . V. I.

The match was played at the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon , Portugal, and contested by Portugal and Greece . The two defences ensured that goal-scoring opportunities were limited, and the score was 0–0 at half-time. Greece scored the only goal of the match after 57 minutes when Angelos Basinas took a corner kick to Angelos Charisteas , who sent a header past goalkeeper Ricardo . Several pundits labelled Greece's tournament win the greatest upset in the history of the European Championship, with their pre-tournament bookmakers' odds at 150–1 . Greece subsequently failed to qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup and did not successfully defend their European Championship in 2008 . Portugal eventually won the European Championship in 2016 .

In his first term as governor, he oversaw the repeal of the sales tax, replacing the lost revenue with new excise taxes and the state's first income tax , and helped improve the state's education and transportation systems. He resigned as governor so his successor could appoint him to the Senate. A fiscal conservative and disciple of Virginia 's Harry F. Byrd , Chandler opposed parts of Roosevelt's New Deal and openly disagreed with the president's decision to prioritize European operations in World War II over the Pacific War . In 1945, he resigned his Senate seat to become the commissioner of baseball , succeeding Kenesaw Mountain Landis . He approved Jackie Robinson 's contract with the Brooklyn Dodgers , initiating the racial integration of Major League Baseball .

Tip of the day Using Math When using math in an article, there are two different types of markup that one can use. It is important to be consistent throughout an article and use the same type of markup. If a formula appears all on the same line, it would be better to use HTML than LaTeX, because L â looks better in line than L â {\displaystyle L^{\infty }} does; however it's generally a bad idea to attempt to render Q ( x ) = 1 2 Ï â« x â e â t 2 / 2 d t = 1 2 erfc âĄ ( x 2 ) , Â x â„ 0 {\displaystyle Q(x)={\frac {1}{\sqrt {2\pi }}}\int _{x}^{\infty }e^{-t^{2}/2}dt={\frac {1}{2}}\,\operatorname {erfc} \left({\frac {x}{\sqrt {2}}}\right),\ x\geq {}0} in HTML.

[1] It is the most general structure in which projective properties are expressed in a coordinate-free way. [2] The technique is based on work by German mathematician Hermann Grassmann on exterior algebra , and subsequently by British mathematician Arthur Cayley 's work on matrices and linear algebra . It is a form of modeling algebra for use in projective geometry . [ citation needed ] The technique uses subspaces as basic elements of computation, a formalism which allows the translation of synthetic geometric statements into invariant algebraic statements. This can create a useful framework for the modeling of conics and quadrics among other forms, and in tensor mathematics. It also has a number of applications in robotics , particularly for the kinematical analysis of manipulators.

""Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That's what we're doing."" — Jimmy Wales Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit, and millions already have . Wikipedia's purpose is to benefit readers by presenting information on all branches of knowledge . Hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation , it consists of freely editable content, whose articles also have numerous links to guide readers towards more information. Written collaboratively by largely anonymous volunteers known as Wikipedians , Wikipedia articles can be edited by anyone with Internet access , except in limited cases where editing is restricted to prevent disruption or vandalism . Since its creation on January 15, 2001 , it has grown into the world's largest reference website , attracting over a billion visitors monthly . Wikipedia currently has more than sixty-three million articles in more than 300 languages , including 6,850,529 articles in English , with 114,409 active contributors in the past month. Wikipedia's fundamental principles are summarized in its five pillars . The Wikipedia community has developed many policies and guidelines , although editors do not need to be familiar with them before contributing. Anyone can edit Wikipedia's text, references, and images. What is written is more important than who writes it. The content must conform with Wikipedia's policies , including being verifiable by published sources . Editors' opinions , beliefs, personal experiences, unreviewed research , libelous material, and copyright violations will not remain. Wikipedia's software allows easy reversal of errors, and experienced editors watch and patrol bad edits. Wikipedia differs from printed references in important ways . It is continually created and updated, and encyclopedic articles on new events appear within minutes rather than months or years. Because anyone can improve Wikipedia, it has become more comprehensive than any other encyclopedia. Its contributors enhance its articles' quality and quantity, and remove misinformation, errors and vandalism . Any reader can fix a mistake or add more information to what has already been written (see Researching with Wikipedia ). Begin by simply clicking the Edit or Edit source buttons or the pencil icon at the top of any non-protected page or section. Wikipedia has tested the wisdom of the crowd since 2001 and found that it succeeds. v t e Basic information on Wikipedia Help directory menu Teahouse (interactive help for new editors) About Wikipedia Readers' index to Wikipedia Statistics Administration FAQs Purpose Who writes Wikipedia?

In mathematics , the Grassmannian G r k ( V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} _{k}(V)} (named in honour of Hermann Grassmann ) is a differentiable manifold that parameterizes the set of all k {\displaystyle k} - dimensional linear subspaces of an n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional vector space V {\displaystyle V} over a field K {\displaystyle K} . For example, the Grassmannian G r 1 ( V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} _{1}(V)} is the space of lines through the origin in V {\displaystyle V} , so it is the same as the projective space P ( V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} (V)} of one dimension lower than V {\displaystyle V} . [1] [2] When V {\displaystyle V} is a real or complex vector space, Grassmannians are compact smooth manifolds , of dimension k ( n − k ) {\displaystyle k(n-k)} . [3] In general they have the structure of a nonsingular projective algebraic variety . The earliest work on a non-trivial Grassmannian is due to Julius Plücker , who studied the set of projective lines in real projective 3-space, which is equivalent to G r 2 ( R 4 ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} _{2}(\mathbf {R} ^{4})} , parameterizing them by what are now called Plücker coordinates . (See § Plücker coordinates and Plücker relations below.) Hermann Grassmann later introduced the concept in general. Notations for Grassmannians vary between authors, and include G r k ( V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} _{k}(V)} , G r ( k , V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} (k,V)} , G r k ( n ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} _{k}(n)} , G r ( k , n ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} (k,n)} to denote the Grassmannian of k {\displaystyle k} -dimensional subspaces of an n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional vector space V {\displaystyle V} . Motivation [ edit ] By giving a collection of subspaces of a vector space a topological structure, it is possible to talk about a continuous choice of subspaces or open and closed collections of subspaces. Giving them the further structure of a differential manifold , one can talk about smooth choices of subspace. A natural example comes from tangent bundles of smooth manifolds embedded in a Euclidean space . Suppose we have a manifold M {\displaystyle M} of dimension k {\displaystyle k} embedded in R n {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} ^{n}} . At each point x ∈ M {\displaystyle x\in M} , the tangent space to M {\displaystyle M} can be considered as a subspace of the tangent space of R n {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} ^{n}} , which is also just R n {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} ^{n}} . The map assigning to x {\displaystyle x} its tangent space defines a map from M to G r k ( R n ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} _{k}(\mathbf {R} ^{n})} . (In order to do this, we have to translate the tangent space at each x ∈ M {\displaystyle x\in M} so that it passes through the origin rather than x {\displaystyle x} , and hence defines a k {\displaystyle k} -dimensional vector subspace. This idea is very similar to the Gauss map for surfaces in a 3-dimensional space.) This can with some effort be extended to all vector bundles over a manifold M {\displaystyle M} , so that every vector bundle generates a continuous map from M {\displaystyle M} to a suitably generalised Grassmannian—although various embedding theorems must be proved to show this. We then find that the properties of our vector bundles are related to the properties of the corresponding maps. In particular we find that vector bundles inducing homotopic maps to the Grassmannian are isomorphic . Here the definition of homotopy relies on a notion of continuity, and hence a topology. Low dimensions [ edit ] For k = 1 , the Grassmannian Gr (1, n ) is the space of lines through the origin in n -space, so it is the same as the projective space P n − 1 {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} ^{n-1}} of n − 1 dimensions. For k = 2 , the Grassmannian is the space of all 2-dimensional planes containing the origin. In Euclidean 3-space, a plane containing the origin is completely characterized by the one and only line through the origin that is perpendicular to that plane (and vice versa); hence the spaces Gr (2, 3) , Gr (1, 3) , and P 2 (the projective plane ) may all be identified with each other. The simplest Grassmannian that is not a projective space is Gr (2, 4) . The Grassmannian as a differentiable manifold [ edit ] To endow G r k ( V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} _{k}(V)} with the structure of a differentiable manifold, choose a basis for V {\displaystyle V} . This is equivalent to identifying V {\displaystyle V} with K n {\displaystyle K^{n}} , with the standard basis denoted ( e 1 , … , e n ) {\displaystyle (e_{1},\dots ,e_{n})} , viewed as column vectors. Then for any k {\displaystyle k} -dimensional subspace w ⊂ V {\displaystyle w\subset V} , viewed as an element of G r k ( V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} _{k}(V)} , we may choose a basis consisting of k {\displaystyle k} linearly independent column vectors ( W 1 , … , W k ) {\displaystyle (W_{1},\dots ,W_{k})} . The homogeneous coordinates of the element w ∈ G r k ( V ) {\displaystyle w\in \mathbf {Gr} _{k}(V)} consist of the elements of the n × k {\displaystyle n\times k} maximal rank rectangular matrix W {\displaystyle W} whose i {\displaystyle i} -th column vector is W i {\displaystyle W_{i}} , i = 1 , … , k {\displaystyle i=1,\dots ,k} . Since the choice of basis is arbitrary, two such maximal rank rectangular matrices W {\displaystyle W} and W ~ {\displaystyle {\tilde {W}}} represent the same element w ∈ G r k ( V ) {\displaystyle w\in \mathbf {Gr} _{k}(V)} if and only if W ~ = W g {\displaystyle {\tilde {W}}=Wg} for some element g ∈ G L ( k , K ) {\displaystyle g\in GL(k,K)} of the general linear group of invertible k × k {\displaystyle k\times k} matrices with entries in K {\displaystyle K} . This defines an equivalence relation between n × k {\displaystyle n\times k} matrices W {\displaystyle W} of rank k {\displaystyle k} , for which the equivalence classes are denoted [ W ] {\displaystyle [W]} . We now define a coordinate atlas. For any n × k {\displaystyle n\times k} homogeneous coordinate matrix W {\displaystyle W} , we can apply elementary column operations (which amounts to multiplying W {\displaystyle W} by a sequence of elements g ∈ G L ( k , K ) {\displaystyle g\in GL(k,K)} ) to obtain its reduced column echelon form . If the first k {\displaystyle k} rows of W {\displaystyle W} are linearly independent, the result will have the form [ 1 1 ⋱ 1 a 1 , 1 ⋯ ⋯ a 1 , k ⋮ ⋮ a n − k , 1 ⋯ ⋯ a n − k , k ] {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}1\\&1\\&&\ddots \\&&&1\\a_{1,1}&\cdots &\cdots &a_{1,k}\\\vdots &&&\vdots \\a_{n-k,1}&\cdots &\cdots &a_{n-k,k}\end{bmatrix}}} and the ( n − k ) × k {\displaystyle (n-k)\times k} affine coordinate matrix A {\displaystyle A} with entries ( a i j ) {\displaystyle (a_{ij})} determines w {\displaystyle w} . In general, the first k {\displaystyle k} rows need not be independent, but since W {\displaystyle W} has maximal rank k {\displaystyle k} , there exists an ordered set of integers 1 ≤ i 1 < ⋯ < i k ≤ n {\displaystyle 1\leq i_{1}<\cdots <i_{k}\leq n} such that the k × k {\displaystyle k\times k} submatrix W i 1 , … , i k {\displaystyle W_{i_{1},\dots ,i_{k}}} whose rows are the ( i 1 , … , i k ) {\displaystyle (i_{1},\ldots ,i_{k})} -th rows of W {\displaystyle W} is nonsingular . We may apply column operations to reduce this submatrix to the identity matrix , and the remaining entries uniquely determine w {\displaystyle w} . Hence we have the following definition: For each ordered set of integers 1 ≤ i 1 < ⋯ < i k ≤ n {\displaystyle 1\leq i_{1}<\cdots <i_{k}\leq n} , let U i 1 , … , i k {\displaystyle U_{i_{1},\dots ,i_{k}}} be the set of elements w ∈ G r k ( V ) {\displaystyle w\in \mathbf {Gr} _{k}(V)} for which, for any choice of homogeneous coordinate matrix W {\displaystyle W} , the k × k {\displaystyle k\times k} submatrix W i 1 , … , i k {\displaystyle W_{i_{1},\dots ,i_{k}}} whose j {\displaystyle j} -th row is the i j {\displaystyle i_{j}} -th row of W {\displaystyle W} is nonsingular. The affine coordinate functions on U i 1 , … , i k {\displaystyle U_{i_{1},\dots ,i_{k}}} are then defined as the entries of the ( n − k ) × k {\displaystyle (n-k)\times k} matrix A i 1 , … , i k {\displaystyle A^{i_{1},\dots ,i_{k}}} whose rows are those of the matrix W W i 1 , … , i k − 1 {\displaystyle WW_{i_{1},\dots ,i_{k}}^{-1}} complementary to ( i 1 , … , i k ) {\displaystyle (i_{1},\dots ,i_{k})} , written in the same order. The choice of homogeneous n × k {\displaystyle n\times k} coordinate matrix W {\displaystyle W} in [ W ] {\displaystyle [W]} representing the element w ∈ G r k ( V ) {\displaystyle w\in \mathbf {Gr} _{k}(V)} does not affect the values of the affine coordinate matrix A i 1 , … , i k {\displaystyle A^{i_{1},\dots ,i_{k}}} representing w on the coordinate neighbourhood U i 1 , … , i k {\displaystyle U_{i_{1},\dots ,i_{k}}} . Moreover, the coordinate matrices A i 1 , … , i k {\displaystyle A^{i_{1},\dots ,i_{k}}} may take arbitrary values, and they define a diffeomorphism from U i 1 , … , i k {\displaystyle U_{i_{1},\dots ,i_{k}}} to the space of K {\displaystyle K} -valued ( n − k ) × k {\displaystyle (n-k)\times k} matrices. Denote by A ^ i 1 , … , i k := W ( W i 1 , … , i k ) − 1 {\displaystyle {\hat {A}}^{i_{1},\dots ,i_{k}}:=W(W_{i_{1},\dots ,i_{k}})^{-1}} the homogeneous coordinate matrix having the identity matrix as the k × k {\displaystyle k\times k} submatrix with rows ( i 1 , … , i k ) {\displaystyle (i_{1},\dots ,i_{k})} and the affine coordinate matrix A i 1 , … , i k {\displaystyle A^{i_{1},\dots ,i_{k}}} in the consecutive complementary rows. On the overlap U i 1 , … , i k ∩ U j 1 , … , j k {\displaystyle U_{i_{1},\dots ,i_{k}}\cap U_{j_{1},\dots ,j_{k}}} between any two such coordinate neighborhoods, the affine coordinate matrix values A i 1 , … , i k {\displaystyle A^{i_{1},\dots ,i_{k}}} and A j 1 , … , j k {\displaystyle A^{j_{1},\dots ,j_{k}}} are related by the transition relations A ^ i 1 , … , i k W i 1 , … , i k = A ^ j 1 , … , j k W j 1 , … , j k , {\displaystyle {\hat {A}}^{i_{1},\dots ,i_{k}}W_{i_{1},\dots ,i_{k}}={\hat {A}}^{j_{1},\dots ,j_{k}}W_{j_{1},\dots ,j_{k}},} where both W i 1 , … , i k {\displaystyle W_{i_{1},\dots ,i_{k}}} and W j 1 , … , j k {\displaystyle W_{j_{1},\dots ,j_{k}}} are invertible. This may equivalently be written as A ^ j 1 , … , j k = A ^ i 1 , … , i k ( A ^ j 1 , … , j k i 1 , … , i k ) − 1 , {\displaystyle {\hat {A}}^{j_{1},\dots ,j_{k}}={\hat {A}}^{i_{1},\dots ,i_{k}}({\hat {A}}_{j_{1},\dots ,j_{k}}^{i_{1},\dots ,i_{k}})^{-1},} where A ^ j 1 , … , j k i 1 , … , i k {\displaystyle {\hat {A}}_{j_{1},\dots ,j_{k}}^{i_{1},\dots ,i_{k}}} is the invertible k × k {\displaystyle k\times k} matrix whose l {\displaystyle l} th row is the j l {\displaystyle j_{l}} th row of A ^ i 1 , … , i k {\displaystyle {\hat {A}}^{i_{1},\dots ,i_{k}}} . The transition functions are therefore rational in the matrix elements of A i 1 , … , i k {\displaystyle A^{i_{1},\dots ,i_{k}}} , and { U i 1 , … , i k , A i 1 , … , i k } {\displaystyle \{U_{i_{1},\dots ,i_{k}},A^{i_{1},\dots ,i_{k}}\}} gives an atlas for G r k ( V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} _{k}(V)} as a differentiable manifold and also as an algebraic variety. The Grassmannian as a set of orthogonal projections [ edit ] An alternative way to define a real or complex Grassmannian as a manifold is to view it as a set of orthogonal projection operators ( Milnor & Stasheff (1974) problem 5-C). For this, choose a positive definite real or Hermitian inner product ⟨ ⋅ , ⋅ ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle \cdot ,\cdot \rangle } on V {\displaystyle V} , depending on whether V {\displaystyle V} is real or complex. A k {\displaystyle k} -dimensional subspace w {\displaystyle w} determines a unique orthogonal projection operator P w : V → V {\displaystyle P_{w}:V\rightarrow V} whose image is w ⊂ V {\displaystyle w\subset V} by splitting V {\displaystyle V} into the orthogonal direct sum V = w ⊕ w ⊥ {\displaystyle V=w\oplus w^{\perp }} of w {\displaystyle w} and its orthogonal complement w ⊥ {\displaystyle w^{\perp }} and defining P w ( v ) = { v if v ∈ w 0 if v ∈ w ⊥ . {\displaystyle P_{w}(v)={\begin{cases}v\quad {\text{ if }}v\in w\\0\quad {\text{ if }}v\in w^{\perp }.\end{cases}}} Conversely, every projection operator P {\displaystyle P} of rank k {\displaystyle k} defines a subspace w P := I m ( P ) {\displaystyle w_{P}:=\mathrm {Im} (P)} as its image. Since the rank of an orthogonal projection operator equals its trace , we can identify the Grassmann manifold G r ( k , V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} (k,V)} with the set of rank k {\displaystyle k} orthogonal projection operators P {\displaystyle P} : G r ( k , V ) ∼ { P ∈ E n d ( V ) ∣ P = P 2 = P † , t r ( P ) = k } . {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} (k,V)\sim \left\{P\in \mathrm {End} (V)\mid P=P^{2}=P^{\dagger },\,\mathrm {tr} (P)=k\right\}.} In particular, taking V = R n {\displaystyle V=\mathbf {R} ^{n}} or V = C n {\displaystyle V=\mathbf {C} ^{n}} this gives completely explicit equations for embedding the Grassmannians G r ( k , R N ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} (k,\mathbf {R} ^{N})} , G r ( k , C N ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} (k,\mathbf {C} ^{N})} in the space of real or complex n × n {\displaystyle n\times n} matrices R n × n {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} ^{n\times n}} , C n × n {\displaystyle \mathbf {C} ^{n\times n}} , respectively. Since this defines the Grassmannian as a closed subset of the sphere { X ∈ E n d ( V ) ∣ t r ( X X † ) = k } {\displaystyle \{X\in \mathrm {End} (V)\mid \mathrm {tr} (XX^{\dagger })=k\}} this is one way to see that the Grassmannian is a compact Hausdorff space. This construction also turns the Grassmannian G r ( k , V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} (k,V)} into a metric space with metric d ( w , w ′ ) := ‖ P w − P w ′ ‖ , {\displaystyle d(w,w'):=\lVert P_{w}-P_{w'}\rVert ,} for any pair w , w ′ ⊂ V {\displaystyle w,w'\subset V} of k {\displaystyle k} -dimensional subspaces, where ‖ ⋅ ‖ denotes the operator norm . The exact inner product used does not matter, because a different inner product will give an equivalent norm on V {\displaystyle V} , and hence an equivalent metric. For the case of real or complex Grassmannians, the following is an equivalent way to express the above construction in terms of matrices. Grassmannians Gr ( k , R n ) and Gr ( k , C n ) as affine algebraic varieties [ edit ] Let M ( n , R ) {\displaystyle M(n,\mathbf {R} )} denote the space of real n × n {\displaystyle n\times n} matrices and the subset P ( k , n , R ) ⊂ M ( n , R ) {\displaystyle P(k,n,\mathbf {R} )\subset M(n,\mathbf {R} )} of matrices P ∈ M ( n , R ) {\displaystyle P\in M(n,\mathbf {R} )} that satisfy the three conditions: P {\displaystyle P} is a projection operator : P 2 = P {\displaystyle P^{2}=P} . P {\displaystyle P} is symmetric : P T = P {\displaystyle P^{T}=P} . P {\displaystyle P} has trace tr ⁡ ( P ) = k {\displaystyle \operatorname {tr} (P)=k} . There is a bijective correspondence between P ( k , n , R ) {\displaystyle P(k,n,\mathbf {R} )} and the Grassmannian G r ( k , R n ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} (k,\mathbf {R} ^{n})} of k {\displaystyle k} -dimensional subspaces of R n {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} ^{n}} given by sending P ∈ P ( k , n , R ) {\displaystyle P\in P(k,n,\mathbf {R} )} to the k {\displaystyle k} -dimensional subspace of R n {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} ^{n}} spanned by its columns and, conversely, sending any element w ∈ G r ( k , R n ) {\displaystyle w\in \mathbf {Gr} (k,\mathbf {R} ^{n})} to the projection matrix P w := ∑ i = 1 k w i w i T , {\displaystyle P_{w}:=\sum _{i=1}^{k}w_{i}w_{i}^{T},} where ( w 1 , ⋯ , w k ) {\displaystyle (w_{1},\cdots ,w_{k})} is any orthonormal basis for w ⊂ R n {\displaystyle w\subset \mathbf {R} ^{n}} , viewed as real n {\displaystyle n} component column vectors. An analogous construction applies to the complex Grassmannian G r ( k , C n ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} (k,\mathbf {C} ^{n})} , identifying it bijectively with the subset P ( k , n , C ) ⊂ M ( n , C ) {\displaystyle P(k,n,\mathbf {C} )\subset M(n,\mathbf {C} )} of complex n × n {\displaystyle n\times n} matrices P ∈ M ( n , C ) {\displaystyle P\in M(n,\mathbf {C} )} satisfying P {\displaystyle P} is a projection operator : P 2 = P {\displaystyle P^{2}=P} . P {\displaystyle P} is self-adjoint (Hermitian): P † = P {\displaystyle P^{\dagger }=P} . P {\displaystyle P} has trace t r ( P ) = k {\displaystyle {\rm {{tr}(P)=k}}} , where the self-adjointness is with respect to the Hermitian inner product ⟨ ⋅ , ⋅ ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle \,\cdot ,\cdot \,\rangle } in which the standard basis vectors ( e 1 , ⋯ , e n ) {\displaystyle (e_{1},\cdots ,e_{n})} are orthonomal. The formula for the orthogonal projection matrix P w {\displaystyle P_{w}} onto the complex k {\displaystyle k} -dimensional subspace w ⊂ C n {\displaystyle w\subset \mathbf {C} ^{n}} spanned by the orthonormal (unitary) basis vectors ( w 1 , ⋯ , w k ) {\displaystyle (w_{1},\cdots ,w_{k})} is P w := ∑ i = 1 k w i w i † . {\displaystyle P_{w}:=\sum _{i=1}^{k}w_{i}w_{i}^{\dagger }.} The Grassmannian as a homogeneous space [ edit ] The quickest way of giving the Grassmannian a geometric structure is to express it as a homogeneous space . First, recall that the general linear group G L ( V ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {GL} (V)} acts transitively on the k {\displaystyle k} -dimensional subspaces of V {\displaystyle V} . Therefore, if we choose a subspace w 0 ⊂ V {\displaystyle w_{0}\subset V} of dimension k {\displaystyle k} , any element w ∈ G r ( k , V ) {\displaystyle w\in \mathbf {Gr} (k,V)} can be expressed as w = g ( w 0 ) {\displaystyle w=g(w_{0})} for some group element g ∈ G L ( V ) {\displaystyle g\in \mathrm {GL} (V)} , where g {\displaystyle g} is determined only up to right multiplication by elements { h ∈ H } {\displaystyle \{h\in H\}} of the stabilizer of w 0 {\displaystyle w_{0}} : H := s t a b ( w 0 ) := { h ∈ G L ( V ) | h ( w 0 ) = w 0 } ⊂ G L ( V ) {\displaystyle H:=\mathrm {stab} (w_{0}):=\{h\in \mathrm {GL} (V)\,|\,h(w_{0})=w_{0}\}\subset \mathrm {GL} (V)} under the G L ( V ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {GL} (V)} -action. We may therefore identify G r ( k , V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} (k,V)} with the quotient space G r ( k , V ) = G L ( V ) / H {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} (k,V)=\mathrm {GL} (V)/H} of left cosets of H {\displaystyle H} . If the underlying field is R {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} } or C {\displaystyle \mathbf {C} } and G L ( V ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {GL} (V)} is considered as a Lie group , this construction makes the Grassmannian a smooth manifold under the quotient structure. More generally, over a ground field K {\displaystyle K} , the group G L ( V ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {GL} (V)} is an algebraic group , and this construction shows that the Grassmannian is a non-singular algebraic variety . It follows from the existence of the Plücker embedding that the Grassmannian is complete as an algebraic variety. In particular, H {\displaystyle H} is a parabolic subgroup of G L ( V ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {GL} (V)} . Over R {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} } or C {\displaystyle \mathbf {C} } it also becomes possible to use smaller groups in this construction. To do this over R {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} } , fix a Euclidean inner product q {\displaystyle q} on V {\displaystyle V} . The real orthogonal group O ( V , q ) {\displaystyle O(V,q)} acts transitively on the set of k {\displaystyle k} -dimensional subspaces G r ( k , V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} (k,V)} and the stabiliser of a k {\displaystyle k} -space w 0 ⊂ V {\displaystyle w_{0}\subset V} is O ( w 0 , q | w 0 ) × O ( w 0 ⊥ , q | w 0 ⊥ ) {\displaystyle O(w_{0},q|_{w_{0}})\times O(w_{0}^{\perp },q|_{w_{0}^{\perp }})} , where w 0 ⊥ {\displaystyle w_{0}^{\perp }} is the orthogonal complement of w 0 {\displaystyle w_{0}} in V {\displaystyle V} . This gives an identification as the homogeneous space G r ( k , V ) = O ( V , q ) / ( O ( w , q | w ) × O ( w ⊥ , q | w ⊥ ) ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} (k,V)=O(V,q)/\left(O(w,q|_{w})\times O(w^{\perp },q|_{w^{\perp }})\right)} . If we take V = R n {\displaystyle V=\mathbf {R} ^{n}} and w 0 = R k ⊂ R n {\displaystyle w_{0}=\mathbf {R} ^{k}\subset \mathbf {R} ^{n}} (the first k {\displaystyle k} components) we get the isomorphism G r ( k , R n ) = O ( n ) / ( O ( k ) × O ( n − k ) ) . {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} (k,\mathbf {R} ^{n})=O(n)/\left(O(k)\times O(n-k)\right).} Over C , if we choose an Hermitian inner product h {\displaystyle h} , the unitary group U ( V , h ) {\displaystyle U(V,h)} acts transitively, and we find analogously G r ( k , V ) = U ( V , h ) / ( U ( w 0 , h | w 0 ) × U ( w 0 ⊥ | , h w 0 ⊥ ) ) , {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} (k,V)=U(V,h)/\left(U(w_{0},h|_{w_{0}})\times U(w_{0}^{\perp }|,h_{w_{0}^{\perp }})\right),} or, for V = C n {\displaystyle V=\mathbf {C} ^{n}} and w 0 = C k ⊂ C n {\displaystyle w_{0}=\mathbf {C} ^{k}\subset \mathbf {C} ^{n}} , G r ( k , C n ) = U ( n ) / ( U ( k ) × U ( n − k ) ) . {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} (k,\mathbf {C} ^{n})=U(n)/\left(U(k)\times U(n-k)\right).} In particular, this shows that the Grassmannian is compact , and of (real or complex) dimension k ( n − k ) . The Grassmannian as a scheme [ edit ] In the realm of algebraic geometry , the Grassmannian can be constructed as a scheme by expressing it as a representable functor . [4] Representable functor [ edit ] Let E {\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}} be a quasi-coherent sheaf on a scheme S {\displaystyle S} . Fix a positive integer k {\displaystyle k} . Then to each S {\displaystyle S} -scheme T {\displaystyle T} , the Grassmannian functor associates the set of quotient modules of E T := E ⊗ O S O T {\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}_{T}:={\mathcal {E}}\otimes _{O_{S}}O_{T}} locally free of rank k {\displaystyle k} on T {\displaystyle T} . We denote this set by G r ( k , E T ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} (k,{\mathcal {E}}_{T})} . This functor is representable by a separated S {\displaystyle S} -scheme G r ( k , E ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} (k,{\mathcal {E}})} . The latter is projective if E {\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}} is finitely generated. When S {\displaystyle S} is the spectrum of a field K {\displaystyle K} , then the sheaf E {\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}} is given by a vector space V {\displaystyle V} and we recover the usual Grassmannian variety of the dual space of V {\displaystyle V} , namely: G r ( k , V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} (k,V)} . By construction, the Grassmannian scheme is compatible with base changes: for any S {\displaystyle S} -scheme S ′ {\displaystyle S'} , we have a canonical isomorphism G r ( k , E ) × S S ′ ≃ G r ( k , E S ′ ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} (k,{\mathcal {E}})\times _{S}S'\simeq \mathbf {Gr} (k,{\mathcal {E}}_{S'})} In particular, for any point s {\displaystyle s} of S {\displaystyle S} , the canonical morphism { s } = Spec K ( s ) → S {\displaystyle \{s\}={\text{Spec}}K(s)\rightarrow S} induces an isomorphism from the fiber G r ( k , E ) s {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} (k,{\mathcal {E}})_{s}} to the usual Grassmannian G r ( k , E ⊗ O S K ( s ) ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} (k,{\mathcal {E}}\otimes _{O_{S}}K(s))} over the residue field K ( s ) {\displaystyle K(s)} . Universal family [ edit ] Since the Grassmannian scheme represents a functor, it comes with a universal object, G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} , which is an object of G r ( k , E G r ( k , E ) ) , {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} \left(k,{\mathcal {E}}_{\mathbf {Gr} (k,{\mathcal {E}})}\right),} and therefore a quotient module G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} of E G r ( k , E ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}_{\mathbf {Gr} (k,{\mathcal {E}})}} , locally free of rank k {\displaystyle k} over G r ( k , E ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} (k,{\mathcal {E}})} . The quotient homomorphism induces a closed immersion from the projective bundle: P ( G ) → P ( E G r ( k , E ) ) = P ( E ) × S G r ( k , E ) . {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} ({\mathcal {G}})\to \mathbf {P} \left({\mathcal {E}}_{\mathbf {Gr} (k,{\mathcal {E}})}\right)=\mathbf {P} ({\mathcal {E}})\times _{S}\mathbf {Gr} (k,{\mathcal {E}}).} For any morphism of S -schemes: T → G r ( k , E ) , {\displaystyle T\to \mathbf {Gr} (k,{\mathcal {E}}),} this closed immersion induces a closed immersion P ( G T ) → P ( E ) × S T . {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} ({\mathcal {G}}_{T})\to \mathbf {P} ({\mathcal {E}})\times _{S}T.} Conversely, any such closed immersion comes from a surjective homomorphism of O T {\displaystyle O_{T}} -modules from E T {\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}_{T}} to a locally free module of rank k {\displaystyle k} . [5] Therefore, the elements of G r ( k , E ) ( T ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} (k,{\mathcal {E}})(T)} are exactly the projective subbundles of rank k {\displaystyle k} in P ( E ) × S T . {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} ({\mathcal {E}})\times _{S}T.} Under this identification, when T = S {\displaystyle T=S} is the spectrum of a field K {\displaystyle K} and E {\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}} is given by a vector space V {\displaystyle V} , the set of rational points G r ( k , E ) ( K ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} (k,{\mathcal {E}})(K)} correspond to the projective linear subspaces of dimension k − 1 {\displaystyle k-1} in P ( V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} (V)} , and the image of P ( G ) ( K ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} ({\mathcal {G}})(K)} in P ( V ) × K G r ( k , E ) \mathbf {P} (V)\times _{K}\mathbf {Gr} (k,{\mathcal {E}}) is the set { ( x , v ) ∈ P ( V ) ( K ) × G r ( k , E ) ( K ) ∣ x ∈ v } . {\displaystyle \left\{(x,v)\in \mathbf {P} (V)(K)\times \mathbf {Gr} (k,{\mathcal {E}})(K)\mid x\in v\right\}.} The Plücker embedding [ edit ] Main article: Plücker embedding The Plücker embedding [6] is a natural embedding of the Grassmannian G r ( k , V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} (k,V)} into the projectivization of the k {\displaystyle k} th Exterior power Λ k V {\displaystyle \Lambda ^{k}V} of V {\displaystyle V} . ι : G r ( k , V ) → P ( Λ k V ) . \iota :\mathbf {Gr} (k,V)\to \mathbf {P} \left(\Lambda ^{k}V\right). Suppose that w ⊂ V {\displaystyle w\subset V} is a k {\displaystyle k} -dimensional subspace of the n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional vector space V {\displaystyle V} . To define ι ( w ) {\displaystyle \iota (w)} , choose a basis ( w 1 , ⋯ , w k ) {\displaystyle (w_{1},\cdots ,w_{k})} for w {\displaystyle w} , and let ι ( w ) {\displaystyle \iota (w)} be the projectivization of the wedge product of these basis elements: ι ( w ) = [ w 1 ∧ ⋯ ∧ w k ] , {\displaystyle \iota (w)=[w_{1}\wedge \cdots \wedge w_{k}],} where [ ⋅ ] {\displaystyle [\,\cdot \,]} denotes the projective equivalence class. A different basis for w {\displaystyle w} will give a different wedge product, but the two will differ only by a non-zero scalar multiple (the determinant of the change of basis matrix). Since the right-hand side takes values in the projectivized space, ι {\displaystyle \iota } is well-defined. To see that it is an embedding, notice that it is possible to recover w {\displaystyle w} from ι ( w ) {\displaystyle \iota (w)} as the span of the set of all vectors v ∈ V {\displaystyle v\in V} such that v ∧ ι ( w ) = 0 {\displaystyle v\wedge \iota (w)=0} . Plücker coordinates and Plücker relations [ edit ] The Plücker embedding of the Grassmannian satisfies a set of simple quadratic relations called the Plücker relations . These show that the Grassmannian G r k ( V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} _{k}(V)} embeds as a nonsingular projective algebraic subvariety of the projectivization P ( Λ k V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} (\Lambda ^{k}V)} of the k {\displaystyle k} th exterior power of V {\displaystyle V} and give another method for constructing the Grassmannian. To state the Plücker relations, fix a basis ( e 1 , ⋯ , e n ) {\displaystyle (e_{1},\cdots ,e_{n})} for V {\displaystyle V} , and let w ⊂ V {\displaystyle w\subset V} be a k {\displaystyle k} -dimensional subspace of V {\displaystyle V} with basis ( w 1 , ⋯ , w k ) {\displaystyle (w_{1},\cdots ,w_{k})} . Let ( w i 1 , ⋯ , w i n ) {\displaystyle (w_{i1},\cdots ,w_{in})} be the components of w i {\displaystyle w_{i}} with respect to the chosen basis of V {\displaystyle V} , and ( W 1 , … , W n ) {\displaystyle (W^{1},\dots ,W^{n})} the k {\displaystyle k} -component column vectors forming the transpose of the corresponding homogeneous coordinate matrix: W T = [ W 1 ⋯ W n ] = [ w 11 ⋯ w 1 n ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ w k 1 ⋯ w k n ] , {\displaystyle W^{T}=[W^{1}\,\cdots W^{n}]={\begin{bmatrix}w_{11}&\cdots &w_{1n}\\\vdots &\ddots &\vdots \\w_{k1}&\cdots &w_{kn}\end{bmatrix}},} For any ordered sequence 1 ≤ i 1 < ⋯ < i k ≤ n {\displaystyle 1\leq i_{1}<\cdots <i_{k}\leq n} of k {\displaystyle k} positive integers, let w i 1 , … , i k {\displaystyle w_{i_{1},\dots ,i_{k}}} be the determinant of the k × k {\displaystyle k\times k} matrix with columns [ W i 1 , … , W i k ] {\displaystyle [W^{i_{1}},\dots ,W^{i_{k}}]} . The elements { w i 1 , … , i k | 1 ≤ i 1 < ⋯ < i k ≤ n } {\displaystyle \{w_{i_{1},\dots ,i_{k}}\,\vert \,1\leq i_{1}<\cdots <i_{k}\leq n\}} are called the Plücker coordinates of the element w ∈ G r k ( V ) {\displaystyle w\in \mathbf {Gr} _{k}(V)} of the Grassmannian (with respect to the basis ( e 1 , ⋯ , e n ) {\displaystyle (e_{1},\cdots ,e_{n})} of V {\displaystyle V} ). These are the linear coordinates of the image ι ( w ) {\displaystyle \iota (w)} of w {\displaystyle w} under the Plücker map, relative to the basis of the exterior power Λ k V {\displaystyle \Lambda ^{k}V} space generated by the basis ( e 1 , ⋯ , e n ) {\displaystyle (e_{1},\cdots ,e_{n})} of V {\displaystyle V} . Since a change of basis for w {\displaystyle w} gives rise to multiplication of the Plücker coordinates by a nonzero constant (the determinant of the change of basis matrix), these are only defined up to projective equivalence, and hence determine a point in P ( Λ k V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} (\Lambda ^{k}V)} . For any two ordered sequences 1 ≤ i 1 < i 2 ⋯ < i k − 1 ≤ n {\displaystyle 1\leq i_{1}<i_{2}\cdots <i_{k-1}\leq n} and 1 ≤ j 1 < j 2 ⋯ < j k + 1 ≤ n {\displaystyle 1\leq j_{1}<j_{2}\cdots <j_{k+1}\leq n} of k − 1 {\displaystyle k-1} and k + 1 {\displaystyle k+1} positive integers, respectively, the following homogeneous quadratic equations, known as the Plücker relations , or the Plücker-Grassmann relations , are valid and determine the image ι ( G r k ( V ) ) {\displaystyle \iota (\mathbf {Gr} _{k}(V))} of G r k ( V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} _{k}(V)} under the Plücker map embedding: ∑ l = 1 k + 1 ( − 1 ) ℓ w i 1 , … , i k − 1 , j l w j 1 , … , j l ^ , … j k + 1 = 0 , {\displaystyle \sum _{l=1}^{k+1}(-1)^{\ell }w_{i_{1},\dots ,i_{k-1},j_{l}}w_{j_{1},\dots ,{\widehat {j_{l}}},\dots j_{k+1}}=0,} where j 1 , … , j l ^ , … j k + 1 {\displaystyle j_{1},\ldots ,{\widehat {j_{l}}},\ldots j_{k+1}} denotes the sequence j 1 , … , j k + 1 {\displaystyle j_{1},\ldots ,j_{k+1}} with the term j l {\displaystyle j_{l}} omitted. These are consistent, determining a nonsingular projective algebraic variety , but they are not algebraically independent. They are equivalent to the statement that ι ( w ) {\displaystyle \iota (w)} is the projectivization of a completely decomposable element of Λ k V {\displaystyle \Lambda ^{k}V} . When dim ⁡ ( V ) = 4 {\displaystyle \dim(V)=4} , and k = 2 {\displaystyle k=2} (the simplest Grassmannian that is not a projective space), the above reduces to a single equation. Denoting the homogeneous coordinates of the image ι ( G r 2 ( V ) ⊂ P ( Λ 2 V ) {\displaystyle \iota (\mathbf {Gr} _{2}(V)\subset \mathbf {P} (\Lambda ^{2}V)} under the Plücker map as ( w 12 , w 13 , w 14 , w 23 , w 24 , w 34 ) {\displaystyle (w_{12},w_{13},w_{14},w_{23},w_{24},w_{34})} , this single Plücker relation is w 12 w 34 − w 13 w 24 + w 14 w 23 = 0. {\displaystyle w_{12}w_{34}-w_{13}w_{24}+w_{14}w_{23}=0.} In general, many more equations are needed to define the image ι ( G r k ( V ) ) {\displaystyle \iota (\mathbf {Gr} _{k}(V))} of the Grassmannian in P ( Λ k V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} (\Lambda ^{k}V)} under the Plücker embedding. Duality [ edit ] Every k {\displaystyle k} -dimensional subspace W ⊂ V {\displaystyle W\subset V} determines an ( n − k ) {\displaystyle (n-k)} -dimensional quotient space V / W {\displaystyle V/W} of V {\displaystyle V} . This gives the natural short exact sequence : 0 → W → V → V / W → 0. {\displaystyle 0\rightarrow W\rightarrow V\rightarrow V/W\rightarrow 0.} Taking the dual to each of these three spaces and the dual linear transformations yields an inclusion of ( V / W ) ∗ {\displaystyle (V/W)^{*}} in V ∗ {\displaystyle V^{*}} with quotient W ∗ {\displaystyle W^{*}} 0 → ( V / W ) ∗ → V ∗ → W ∗ → 0. {\displaystyle 0\rightarrow (V/W)^{*}\rightarrow V^{*}\rightarrow W^{*}\rightarrow 0.} Using the natural isomorphism of a finite-dimensional vector space with its double dual shows that taking the dual again recovers the original short exact sequence. Consequently there is a one-to-one correspondence between k {\displaystyle k} -dimensional subspaces of V {\displaystyle V} and ( n − k ) {\displaystyle (n-k)} -dimensional subspaces of V ∗ {\displaystyle V^{*}} . In terms of the Grassmannian, this gives a canonical isomorphism G r k ( V ) ↔ G r ( n − k , V ∗ ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} _{k}(V)\leftrightarrow \mathbf {Gr} {(n-k},V^{*})} that associates to each subspace W ⊂ V {\displaystyle W\subset V} its annihilator W 0 ⊂ V ∗ {\displaystyle W^{0}\subset V^{*}} . Choosing an isomorphism of V {\displaystyle V} with V ∗ {\displaystyle V^{*}} therefore determines a (non-canonical) isomorphism between G r k ( V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} _{k}(V)} and G r n − k ( V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} _{n-k}(V)} . An isomorphism of V {\displaystyle V} with V ∗ {\displaystyle V^{*}} is equivalent to the choice of an inner product, so with respect to the chosen inner product, this isomorphism of Grassmannians sends any k {\displaystyle k} -dimensional subspace into its ( n − k ) {\displaystyle (n-k)} }-dimensional orthogonal complement . Schubert cells [ edit ] The detailed study of Grassmannians makes use of a decomposition into affine subpaces called Schubert cells , which were first applied in enumerative geometry . The Schubert cells for G r k ( V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} _{k}(V)} are defined in terms of a specified complete flag of subspaces V 1 ⊂ V 2 ⊂ ⋯ ⊂ V n = V {\displaystyle V_{1}\subset V_{2}\subset \cdots \subset V_{n}=V} of dimension d i m ( V i ) = i {\displaystyle \mathrm {dim} (V_{i})=i} . For any integer partition λ = ( λ 1 , ⋯ , λ k ) {\displaystyle \lambda =(\lambda _{1},\cdots ,\lambda _{k})} of weight | λ | = ∑ i = 1 k λ i {\displaystyle |\lambda |=\sum _{i=1}^{k}\lambda _{i}} consisting of weakly decreasing non-negative integers λ 1 ≥ ⋯ ≥ λ k ≥ 0 , {\displaystyle \lambda _{1}\geq \cdots \geq \lambda _{k}\geq 0,} whose Young diagram fits within the rectangular one ( n − k ) k {\displaystyle (n-k)^{k}} , the Schubert cell X λ ( k , n ) ⊂ G r k ( V ) {\displaystyle X_{\lambda }(k,n)\subset \mathbf {Gr} _{k}(V)} consists of those elements W ∈ G r k ( V ) {\displaystyle W\in \mathbf {Gr} _{k}(V)} whose intersections with the subspaces { V i } {\displaystyle \{V_{i}\}} have the following dimensions X λ ( k , n ) = { W ∈ G r k ( V ) | dim ⁡ ( W ∩ V n − k + j − λ j ) = j } . {\displaystyle X_{\lambda }(k,n)=\{W\in \mathbf {Gr} _{k}(V)\,|\,\dim(W\cap V_{n-k+j-\lambda _{j}})=j\}.} These are affine spaces, and their closures (within the Zariski topology ) are known as Schubert varieties . As an example of the technique, consider the problem of determining the Euler characteristic χ k , n {\displaystyle \chi _{k,n}} of the Grassmannian G r k ( R n ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} _{k}(\mathbf {R} ^{n})} of k -dimensional subspaces of R n . Fix a 1 {\displaystyle 1} -dimensional subspace R ⊂ R n {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} \subset \mathbf {R} ^{n}} and consider the partition of G r k ( R n ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} _{k}(\mathbf {R} ^{n})} into those k -dimensional subspaces of R n that contain R and those that do not. The former is G r k − 1 ( R n − 1 ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} _{k-1}(\mathbf {R} ^{n-1})} and the latter is a rank k {\displaystyle k} vector bundle over G r k ( R n − 1 ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} _{k}(\mathbf {R} ^{n-1})} . This gives recursive formulae: χ k , n = χ k − 1 , n − 1 + ( − 1 ) k χ k , n − 1 , χ 0 , n = χ n , n = 1. {\displaystyle \chi _{k,n}=\chi _{k-1,n-1}+(-1)^{k}\chi _{k,n-1},\qquad \chi _{0,n}=\chi _{n,n}=1.} Solving these recursion relations gives the formula: χ k , n = 0 {\displaystyle \chi _{k,n}=0} if n {\displaystyle n} is even and k {\displaystyle k} is odd and χ k , n = ( ⌊ n 2 ⌋ ⌊ k 2 ⌋ ) {\displaystyle \chi _{k,n}={\begin{pmatrix}\left\lfloor {\frac {n}{2}}\right\rfloor \\\left\lfloor {\frac {k}{2}}\right\rfloor \end{pmatrix}}} otherwise. Cohomology ring of the complex Grassmannian [ edit ] Every point in the complex Grassmann manifold G r k ( C n ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} _{k}(\mathbf {C} ^{n})} defines a k {\displaystyle k} -plane in n {\displaystyle n} -space. Fibering these planes over the Grassmannian one arrives at the vector bundle E {\displaystyle E} which generalizes the tautological bundle of a projective space . Similarly the ( n − k ) {\displaystyle (n-k)} -dimensional orthogonal complements of these planes yield an orthogonal vector bundle F {\displaystyle F} . The integral cohomology of the Grassmannians is generated, as a ring , by the Chern classes of E {\displaystyle E} . In particular, all of the integral cohomology is at even degree as in the case of a projective space. These generators are subject to a set of relations, which defines the ring. The defining relations are easy to express for a larger set of generators, which consists of the Chern classes of E {\displaystyle E} and F {\displaystyle F} . Then the relations merely state that the direct sum of the bundles E {\displaystyle E} and F {\displaystyle F} is trivial. Functoriality of the total Chern classes allows one to write this relation as c ( E ) c ( F ) = 1. {\displaystyle c(E)c(F)=1.} The quantum cohomology ring was calculated by Edward Witten . [7] The generators are identical to those of the classical cohomology ring, but the top relation is changed to c k ( E ) c n − k ( F ) = ( − 1 ) n − k {\displaystyle c_{k}(E)c_{n-k}(F)=(-1)^{n-k}} reflecting the existence in the corresponding quantum field theory of an instanton with 2 n {\displaystyle 2n} fermionic zero-modes which violates the degree of the cohomology corresponding to a state by 2 n {\displaystyle 2n} units. Associated measure [ edit ] When V {\displaystyle V} is an n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional Euclidean space, we may define a uniform measure on G r k ( V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} _{k}(V)} in the following way. Let θ n {\displaystyle \theta _{n}} be the unit Haar measure on the orthogonal group O ( n ) {\displaystyle O(n)} and fix w ∈ G r k ( V ) {\displaystyle w\in \mathbf {Gr} _{k}(V)} . Then for a set A ⊂ G r k ( V ) {\displaystyle A\subset \mathbf {Gr} _{k}(V)} , define γ k , n ( A ) = θ n { g ∈ O ⁡ ( n ) : g w ∈ A } . {\displaystyle \gamma _{k,n}(A)=\theta _{n}\{g\in \operatorname {O} (n):gw\in A\}.} This measure is invariant under the action of the group O ( n ) {\displaystyle O(n)} ; that is, γ k , n ( g A ) = γ k , n ( A ) {\displaystyle \gamma _{k,n}(gA)=\gamma _{k,n}(A)} for all g ∈ O ( n ) {\displaystyle g\in O(n)} . Since θ n ( O ( n ) ) = 1 {\displaystyle \theta _{n}(O(n))=1} , we have γ k , n ( G r k ( V ) ) = 1 {\displaystyle \gamma _{k,n}(\mathbf {Gr} _{k}(V))=1} . Moreover, γ k , n {\displaystyle \gamma _{k,n}} is a Radon measure with respect to the metric space topology and is uniform in the sense that every ball of the same radius (with respect to this metric) is of the same measure. Oriented Grassmannian [ edit ] This is the manifold consisting of all oriented k {\displaystyle k} -dimensional subspaces of R n {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} ^{n}} . It is a double cover of G r k ( R n ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} _{k}(\mathbf {R} ^{n})} and is denoted by G r ~ k ( R n ) {\displaystyle {\widetilde {\mathbf {Gr} }}_{k}(\mathbf {R} ^{n})} . As a homogeneous space it can be expressed as: G r ~ k ( R n ) = SO ⁡ ( n ) / ( SO ⁡ ( k ) × SO ⁡ ( n − k ) ) . {\displaystyle {\widetilde {\mathbf {Gr} }}_{k}(\mathbf {R} ^{n})=\operatorname {SO} (n)/(\operatorname {SO} (k)\times \operatorname {SO} (n-k)).} Orthogonal isotropic Grassmannians [ edit ] Given a real or complex nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form Q {\displaystyle Q} on the n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional space V {\displaystyle V} (i.e., a scalar product), the totally isotropic Grassmannian G r k 0 ( V , Q ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} _{k}^{0}(V,Q)} is defined as the subvariety G r k 0 ( V , Q ) ⊂ G r k ( V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} _{k}^{0}(V,Q)\subset \mathbf {Gr} _{k}(V)} consisting of all k {\displaystyle k} -dimensional subspaces w ⊂ V {\displaystyle w\subset V} for which Q ( u , v ) = 0 , ∀ u , v ∈ w . {\displaystyle Q(u,v)=0,\,\forall \,u,v\in w.} Maximal isotropic Grassmannians with respect to a real or complex scalar product are closely related to Cartan's theory of spinors . [8] Under the Cartan embedding, their connected components are equivariantly diffeomorphic to the projectivized minimal spinor orbit, under the spin representation, the so-called projective pure spinor variety which, similarly to the image of the Plücker map embedding , is cut out as the intersection of a number of quadrics, the Cartan quadrics . [8] [9] [10] Applications [ edit ] A key application of Grassmannians is as the ""universal"" embedding space for bundles with connections on compact manifolds. [11] [12] Another important application is Schubert calculus , which is the enumerative geometry involved in calculating the number of points, lines, planes, etc. in a projective space that intersect a given set of points, lines, etc., using the intersection theory of Schubert varieties . Subvarieties of Schubert cells can also be used to parametrize simultaneous eigenvectors of complete sets of commuting operators in quantum integrable spin systems, such as the Gaudin model , using the Bethe ansatz method. [13] A further application is to the solution of hierarchies of classical completely integrable systems of partial differential equations, such as the Kadomtsev–Petviashvili equation and the associated KP hierarchy . These can be expressed in terms of abelian group flows on an infinite-dimensional Grassmann manifold. [14] [15] [16] [17] The KP equations, expressed in Hirota bilinear form in terms of the KP Tau function are equivalent to the Plücker relations . [18] [17] A similar construction holds for solutions of the BKP integrable hierarchy, in terms of abelian group flows on an infinite dimensional maximal isotropic Grassmann manifold. [15] [16] [19] Finite dimensional positive Grassmann manifolds can be used to express soliton solutions of KP equations which are nonsingular for real values of the KP flow parameters. [20] [21] [22] The scattering amplitudes of subatomic particles in maximally supersymmetric super Yang-Mills theory may be calculated in the planar limit via a positive Grassmannian construct called the amplituhedron . [23] Grassmann manifolds have also found applications in computer vision tasks of video-based face recognition and shape recognition, [24] and are used in the data-visualization technique known as the grand tour . See also [ edit ] Schubert calculus For an example of the use of Grassmannians in differential geometry , see Gauss map In projective geometry , see Plücker embedding and Plücker co-ordinates . Flag manifolds are generalizations of Grassmannians whose elements, viewed geometrically, are nested sequences of subspaces of specified dimensions. Stiefel manifolds are bundles of orthonormal frames over Grassmanians. Given a distinguished class of subspaces, one can define Grassmannians of these subspaces, such as Isotropic Grassmanians or Lagrangian Grassmannians . Isotropic Grassmanian Lagrangian Grassmannian Grassmannians provide classifying spaces in K-theory , notably the classifying space for U( n ) . In the homotopy theory of schemes , the Grassmannian plays a similar role for algebraic K-theory .

This article contains phonetic transcriptions in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) . For an introductory guide on IPA symbols, see Help:IPA . For the distinction between [ ] , / / and ⟨ ⟩, see IPA § Brackets and transcription delimiters . Hermann Grassmann Grassmann's law , named after its discoverer Hermann Grassmann , is a dissimilatory phonological process in Ancient Greek and Sanskrit which states that if an aspirated consonant is followed by another aspirated consonant in the next syllable, the first one loses the aspiration. The descriptive version was given for Sanskrit by Pāṇini . Here are some examples in Greek of the effects of Grassmann's law: / tʰ ú-ɔː/ θύω 'I sacrifice (an animal)'; /e- t ú- tʰ ɛː/ ἐτύθη 'it was sacrificed' / tʰ rí k -s/ θρίξ 'hair'; / t rí kʰ -es/ τρίχες 'hairs' / tʰ á p t-ein/ θάπτειν 'to bury (present)'; / t á pʰ -os/ τάφος 'a grave' In reduplication , which forms the perfect tense in both Greek and Sanskrit, if the initial consonant is aspirated, the prepended consonant is unaspirated by Grassmann's law. For instance / pʰ u-ɔː/ φύω 'I grow' : / p e- pʰ uː-ka/ πέφυκα 'I have grown'. The fact that deaspiration in Greek took place after the change of Proto-Indo-European *bʰ, *dʰ, *gʰ to /pʰ, tʰ, kʰ/ (PIE *bʰn̥ǵʰús > παχύς ( pakhús ) not bakhús but Sanskrit बहु ( bahú )) and the fact that all other Indo-European languages do not apply Grassmann's law both suggest that it was developed separately in Greek and Sanskrit (although quite possibly by areal influence spread across a then-contiguous Graeco-Aryan –speaking area) and so it was not inherited from Proto-Indo-European. [1] Also, Grassmann's law in Greek also affects the aspirate /h-/ < *s- developed specifically in Greek but not in Sanskrit or most other Indo-European. (For example, *ségʰō > *hekʰō > ἔχω /é kʰ ɔː/ ""I have"", with dissimilation of *h...kʰ , but the future tense *ségʰ-sō > ἕξω / h é k -sɔː/ ""I will have"" was unaffected, as aspiration was lost before /s/ .) The evidence from other languages is not strictly negative: many branches, including Sanskrit's closest relative, Iranian , merge the Proto-Indo-European voiced aspirated and unaspirated stops and so it is not possible to tell if Grassmann's law ever operated in them. According to Filip De Decker, [2] Grassmann's law had not operated in Mycenaean Greek yet, and it is almost certain that it occurred later than 1200 BC; it might even postdate the Homeric Greek period. In Greek [ edit ] In Koine Greek , in cases other than reduplication, alternations involving labials and velars have been completely levelled , and Grassmann's law remains in effect only for the alternation between /t/ and /tʰ/ , as in the last two examples above. (It makes no difference whether the /tʰ/ in question continues Proto-Indo-European *dʰ or *ɡʷʰ .) Thus, alongside the pair ταχύς / t a kʰ ús/ 'fast' : θάσσων / tʰ ássɔːn/ 'faster', displaying Grassmann's law, Greek has the pair παχύς / p a kʰ ús/ 'thick' : πάσσων / p ássɔːn/ 'thicker' from the Proto-Indo-European etymon *bʰn̻ɡʰ- (established by cognate forms like Sanskrit बहु /bahú-/ 'abundant' since *bʰ is the only point of intersection between Greek /p/ and Sanskrit /b/ ) in which the /p/ in the comparative is a result of levelling. Similarly, πεύθομαι / p eú tʰ omai/ ~ πυνθάνομαι / p un tʰ ánomai/ 'come to know' from PIE *bʰeudʰ- has the future πεύσομαι / p eúsomai/ . However, only /tʰ/ dissimilates before aspirated affixes like the aorist passive in /-tʰɛː/ and the imperative in /-tʰi/ ; /pʰ/ and /kʰ/ do not, as in φάθι / pʰ á tʰ i/ 'speak!'. Diaspirate roots [ edit ] Cases like /tʰrík-s/ ~ /tríkʰ-es/ and /tʰáp-sai/ ~ /tapʰ-eîn/ illustrate the phenomenon of diaspirate roots for which two different analyses have been given. In one account, the underlying diaspirate theory, the underlying roots are taken to be /tʰrikʰ/ and /tʰapʰ/ . When an /s/ , a word edge, or various other sounds immediately follow, the second aspiration is lost, and the first aspirate therefore survives ( /tʰrík-s/ , /tʰáp-sai/ ). If a vowel follows the second aspirate, the second aspirate survives unaltered, and the first aspiration is thus lost by Grassmann's law ( /tríkʰ-es/ , /tápʰ-os/ ). A different analytical approach was taken by the Indian grammarians. They took the roots to be underlying /trikʰ/ and /tapʰ/ . The roots persist unaltered in /tríkʰ-es/ and /tapʰ-eîn/ . If an /s/ follows, it triggers an aspiration throwback and the aspiration migrates leftward, docking onto the initial consonant ( /tʰrík-s/ , /tʰáp-sai/ ). In his initial formulation of the law, Grassmann briefly referred to aspiration throwback to explain the seemingly aberrant forms. However, the consensus among contemporary historical linguists is that the former explanation (underlying representation) is the correct one, as aspiration throwback would require multiple root shapes for the same basic root in different languages whenever an aspirate follows in the next syllable ( *d for Sanskrit, *t for Greek, *dʰ for Proto-Germanic and Proto-Italic which have no dissimilation), but the underlying diaspirate allows for a single root shape, with *dʰ for all languages. In the later course of Sanskrit, under the influence of the grammarians, aspiration throwback was applied to original mono-aspirate roots by analogy . Thus, from the verb root गाह /ɡaːh-/ ('to plunge'), the desiderative stem जिघाख /dʑi-ɡʱaːkʰa-/ is formed by analogy with the forms बुभुत्सा /bu-bʱutsaː-/ (a desiderative form) and भुत /bʱut-/ (a nominal form, both from the root बुध /budʱ-/ 'to be awake', originally Proto-Indo-European *bʰudʰ- ). The linguist Ivan Sag has pointed out an advantage of the ancient Indian theory: it explains why there are no patterns like hypothetical */trík-s/ ~ */tríkʰ-es/ , which are not ruled out by the underlying diaspirate theory. However, aspiration fails to account for reduplication patterns in roots with initial aspirates, such as Greek /tí-tʰɛːmi/ 'I put', with an unaspirated reduplicated consonant. Aspiration throwback thus needs to be enhanced with a stipulation that aspirates reduplicate as their unaspirated counterparts. From a diachronic standpoint, the absence of these patterns in Greek is explained by the Proto-Indo-European constraint against roots of the form *T...Dʰ- . Other languages [ edit ] Processes similar to Grassmann's law continue to work in Middle Indo-Aryan , although it tends to be inconsistent regarding direction, for example Sanskrit स्कन्ध ( sk andha ) → kh andha → Assamese কান্ধ ( k andh ), but भ्रष्ट ( bhra ṣṭ a ) → bha ṭṭh a → ভাটা ( bha t a ). [3] A process similar to Grassmann's law is also known to occur in Ofo , an extinct and underdocumented Siouan language. The law is found in compounds such as the following: ós kh a ('the crane') + afháⁿ ('white') → os k ạfha ('the white egret') A similar phenomenon occurs in Meitei (a Tibeto-Burman language) in which an aspirated consonant is deaspirated if preceded by an aspirated consonant (including /h/, /s/ ) in the previous syllable. The deaspirated consonants are then voiced between sonorants. /tʰin-/ ('pierce') + /- kʰ ət/ ('upward') → /tʰin ɡ ət/ ('pierce upwards') /səŋ/ ('cow') + / kʰ om/ ('udder') → /səŋ ɡ om/ ('milk') /hi-/ ('trim') + /- tʰ ok/ ('outward') → /hi d ok/ ('trim outwards') Hadza , spoken in Northern Tanzania, exhibits Grassmann's law in its lexicon, but most obviously in reduplication: /tʃe-tʃʰeʔe-mae/ 'look at each other', from /tʃʰeʔe/ 'look' In Hadza, /h/ has no effect on aspiration. A similar effect takes place in Koti and other Makhuwa languages , where it was dubbed Katupha's law in Schadeberg (1999). If two aspirated consonants are brought together in one stem, the first loses its aspiration. The effect is particularly clear in reduplicated words: kopikophi 'eyelash'; piriphiri 'pepper' (cf. Swahili 'piripiri'); okukuttha 'to wipe'. This is slightly different from in Greek and Sanskrit, in that the two syllables need not be adjacent. The four Salishan languages Salish–Spokane–Kalispel , Okanagan , Shuswap and Tillamook exhibit a similar process affecting ejective rather than aspirated consonants, which has been called ""Grassmann's law for Salish"", for example Shuswap underlying /x- tʼ ək-tʼəkʔ-éχn/ 'crutches' → surface /x t əktʼəkʔéχn/ .

The vertices of the Grassmann graph J q ( n , k ) are the k -dimensional subspaces of an n -dimensional vector space over a finite field of order q ; two vertices are adjacent when their intersection is ( k – 1) -dimensional. Many of the parameters of Grassmann graphs are q -analogs of the parameters of Johnson graphs , and Grassmann graphs have several of the same graph properties as Johnson graphs. Graph-theoretic properties [ edit ] J q ( n , k ) is isomorphic to J q ( n , n – k ) . For all 0 ≤ d ≤ diam( J q ( n , k )) , the intersection of any pair of vertices at distance d is ( k – d ) -dimensional. The clique number of J q ( n , k ) is given by an expression in terms its least and greatest eigenvalues λ min and λ max : ω ( J q ( n , k ) ) = 1 − λ max λ min {\displaystyle \omega \left(J_{q}(n,k)\right)=1-{\frac {\lambda _{\max }}{\lambda _{\min }}}} [ citation needed ] Automorphism group [ edit ] There is a distance-transitive subgroup of Aut ⁡ ( J q ( n , k ) ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Aut} (J_{q}(n,k))} isomorphic to the projective linear group P Γ L ⁡ ( n , q ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {P\Gamma L} (n,q)} .

More precisely, the Plücker map embeds G r ( k , V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} (k,V)} into the projectivization P ( Λ k V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} (\Lambda ^{k}V)} of the k {\displaystyle k} -th exterior power of V {\displaystyle V} . The image is algebraic, consisting of the intersection of a number of quadrics defined by the § Plücker relations (see below). The Plücker embedding was first defined by Julius Plücker in the case k = 2 , n = 4 {\displaystyle k=2,n=4} as a way of describing the lines in three-dimensional space (which, as projective lines in real projective space, correspond to two-dimensional subspaces of a four-dimensional vector space). The image of that embedding is the Klein quadric in RP 5 . Hermann Grassmann generalized Plücker's embedding to arbitrary k and n . The homogeneous coordinates of the image of the Grassmannian G r ( k , V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} (k,V)} under the Plücker embedding, relative to the basis in the exterior space Λ k V {\displaystyle \Lambda ^{k}V} corresponding to the natural basis in V = K n {\displaystyle V=K^{n}} (where K {\displaystyle K} is the base field ) are called Plücker coordinates . Definition [ edit ] Denoting by V = K n {\displaystyle V=K^{n}} the n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional vector space over the field K {\displaystyle K} , and by G r ( k , V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} (k,V)} the Grassmannian of k {\displaystyle k} -dimensional subspaces of V {\displaystyle V} , the Plücker embedding is the map ι defined by ι : G r ( k , V ) → P ( Λ k V ) , ι : W := span ⁡ ( w 1 , … , w k ) ↦ [ w 1 ∧ ⋯ ∧ w k ] , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\iota \colon \mathbf {Gr} (k,V)&{}\rightarrow \mathbf {P} (\Lambda ^{k}V),\\\iota \colon {\mathcal {W}}:=\operatorname {span} (w_{1},\ldots ,w_{k})&{}\mapsto [w_{1}\wedge \cdots \wedge w_{k}],\end{aligned}}} where ( w 1 , … , w k ) {\displaystyle (w_{1},\dots ,w_{k})} is a basis for the element W ∈ G r ( k , V ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {W}}\in \mathbf {Gr} (k,V)} and [ w 1 ∧ ⋯ ∧ w k ] {\displaystyle [w_{1}\wedge \cdots \wedge w_{k}]} is the projective equivalence class of the element w 1 ∧ ⋯ ∧ w k ∈ Λ k V {\displaystyle w_{1}\wedge \cdots \wedge w_{k}\in \Lambda ^{k}V} of the k {\displaystyle k} th exterior power of V {\displaystyle V} . This is an embedding of the Grassmannian into the projectivization P ( Λ k V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} (\Lambda ^{k}V)} . The image can be completely characterized as the intersection of a number of quadrics, the Plücker quadrics (see below), which are expressed by homogeneous quadratic relations on the Plücker coordinates (see below) that derive from linear algebra . The bracket ring appears as the ring of polynomial functions on Λ k V {\displaystyle \Lambda ^{k}V} . [1] Plücker relations [ edit ] The image under the Plücker embedding satisfies a simple set of homogeneous quadratic relations, usually called the Plücker relations , or Grassmann–Plücker relations , defining the intersection of a number of quadrics in P ( Λ k V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} (\Lambda ^{k}V)} . This shows that the Grassmannian embeds as an algebraic subvariety of P ( Λ k V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} (\Lambda ^{k}V)} and gives another method of constructing the Grassmannian. To state the Grassmann–Plücker relations, let W ∈ G r ( k , V ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {W}}\in \mathbf {Gr} (k,V)} be the k {\displaystyle k} -dimensional subspace spanned by the basis represented by column vectors W 1 , … , W k {\displaystyle W_{1},\dots ,W_{k}} . Let W {\displaystyle W} be the n × k {\displaystyle n\times k} matrix of homogeneous coordinates, whose columns are W 1 , … , W k {\displaystyle W_{1},\dots ,W_{k}} . Then the equivalence class [ W ] {\displaystyle [W]} of all such homogeneous coordinates matrices W g ∼ W {\displaystyle Wg\sim W} related to each other by right multiplication by an invertible k × k {\displaystyle k\times k} matrix g ∈ G L ( k , K ) {\displaystyle g\in \mathbf {GL} (k,K)} may be identified with the element W {\displaystyle {\mathcal {W}}} . For any ordered sequence 1 ≤ i 1 < ⋯ < i k ≤ n {\displaystyle 1\leq i_{1}<\cdots <i_{k}\leq n} of k {\displaystyle k} integers, let W i 1 , … , i k {\displaystyle W_{i_{1},\dots ,i_{k}}} be the determinant of the k × k {\displaystyle k\times k} matrix whose rows are the rows ( i 1 , … i k ) {\displaystyle (i_{1},\dots i_{k})} of W {\displaystyle W} . Then, up to projectivization, { W i 1 , … , i k } {\displaystyle \{W_{i_{1},\dots ,i_{k}}\}} are the Plücker coordinates of the element W ∼ [ W ] ∈ G r ( k , V ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {W}}\sim [W]\in \mathbf {Gr} (k,V)} whose homogeneous coordinates are W {\displaystyle W} . They are the linear coordinates of the image ι ( W ) {\displaystyle \iota ({\mathcal {W}})} of W ∈ G r ( k , V ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {W}}\in \mathbf {Gr} (k,V)} under the Plücker map, relative to the standard basis in the exterior space Λ k V {\displaystyle \Lambda ^{k}V} . Changing the basis defining the homogeneous coordinate matrix M {\displaystyle M} just changes the Plücker coordinates by a nonzero scaling factor equal to the determinant of the change of basis matrix g {\displaystyle g} , and hence just the representative of the projective equivalence class in Λ k V {\displaystyle \Lambda ^{k}V} . For any two ordered sequences: i 1 < i 2 < ⋯ < i k − 1 , j 1 < j 2 < ⋯ < j k + 1 {\displaystyle i_{1}<i_{2}<\cdots <i_{k-1},\quad j_{1}<j_{2}<\cdots <j_{k+1}} of positive integers 1 ≤ i l , j m ≤ n {\displaystyle 1\leq i_{l},j_{m}\leq n} , the following homogeneous equations are valid, and determine the image of W {\displaystyle {\mathcal {W}}} under the Plücker map: [2] ∑ l = 1 k + 1 ( − 1 ) l W i 1 , … , i k − 1 , j l W j 1 , … , j ^ l , … j k + 1 = 0 , {\displaystyle \sum _{l=1}^{k+1}(-1)^{l}W_{i_{1},\dots ,i_{k-1},j_{l}}W_{j_{1},\dots ,{\hat {j}}_{l},\dots j_{k+1}}=0,} ( 1 ) where j 1 , … , j ^ l … j k + 1 {\displaystyle j_{1},\dots ,{\hat {j}}_{l}\dots j_{k+1}} denotes the sequence j 1 , … , … j k + 1 {\displaystyle j_{1},\dots ,\dots j_{k+1}} with the term j l {\displaystyle j_{l}} omitted. These are generally referred to as the Plücker relations . When dim( V ) = 4 and k = 2 , we get G r ( 2 , V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} (2,V)} , the simplest Grassmannian which is not a projective space, and the above reduces to a single equation. Denoting the coordinates of Λ 2 V {\displaystyle \Lambda ^{2}V} by W i j = − W j i , 1 ≤ i , j ≤ 4 , {\displaystyle W_{ij}=-W_{ji},\quad 1\leq i,j\leq 4,} the image of G r ( 2 , V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} (2,V)} under the Plücker map is defined by the single equation W 12 W 34 − W 13 W 24 + W 14 W 23 = 0. {\displaystyle W_{12}W_{34}-W_{13}W_{24}+W_{14}W_{23}=0.} In general, many more equations are needed to define the image of the Plücker embedding, as in ( 1 ), but these are not, in general, algebraically independent . The maximal number of algebraically independent relations (on Zariski open sets) is given by the difference of dimension between P ( Λ k V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} (\Lambda ^{k}V)} and G r ( k , V ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Gr} (k,V)} , which is ( n k ) − k ( n − k ) − 1. {\displaystyle {\tbinom {n}{k}}-k(n-k)-1.} References [ edit ] ^ Björner, Anders ; Las Vergnas, Michel ; Sturmfels, Bernd ; White, Neil; Ziegler, Günter (1999), Oriented matroids , Encyclopedia of Mathematics and Its Applications, vol. 46 (2nd ed.), Cambridge University Press , p. 79, doi : 10.1017/CBO9780511586507 , ISBN 0-521-77750-X , Zbl 0944.52006 ^ Griffiths, Phillip ; Harris, Joseph (1994), Principles of algebraic geometry , Wiley Classics Library (2nd ed.), New York: John Wiley & Sons , p. 211, ISBN 0-471-05059-8 , MR 1288523 , Zbl 0836.14001 Further reading [ edit ] Miller, Ezra; Sturmfels, Bernd (2005).

In one it is the manifold of all k -dimensional affine subspaces of R n (described on this page), while in the other the affine Grassmannian is a quotient of a group-ring based on formal Laurent series. Formal definition [ edit ] Given a finite-dimensional vector space V and a non-negative integer k , then Graff k ( V ) is the topological space of all affine k -dimensional subspaces of V . It has a natural projection p :Graff k ( V ) → Gr k ( V ), the Grassmannian of all linear k -dimensional subspaces of V by defining p ( U ) to be the translation of U to a subspace through the origin. This projection is a fibration, and if V is given an inner product, the fibre containing U can be identified with p ( U ) ⊥ {\displaystyle p(U)^{\perp }} , the orthogonal complement to p ( U ). The fibres are therefore vector spaces, and the projection p is a vector bundle over the Grassmannian , which defines the manifold structure on Graff k ( V ). As a homogeneous space , the affine Grassmannian of an n -dimensional vector space V can be identified with G r a f f k ( V ) ≃ E ( n ) E ( k ) × O ( n − k ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {Graff} _{k}(V)\simeq {\frac {E(n)}{E(k)\times O(n-k)}}} where E ( n ) is the Euclidean group of R n and O( m ) is the orthogonal group on R m . It follows that the dimension is given by dim ⁡ [ G r a f f k ( V ) ] = ( n − k ) ( k + 1 ) . {\displaystyle \dim \left[\mathrm {Graff} _{k}(V)\right]=(n-k)(k+1)\,.} (This relation is easier to deduce from the identification of next section, as the difference between the number of coefficients, ( n − k )( n +1) and the dimension of the linear group acting on the equations, ( n − k ) 2 .) Relationship with ordinary Grassmannian [ edit ] Let ( x 1 ,..., x n ) be the usual linear coordinates on R n . Then R n is embedded into R n +1 as the affine hyperplane x n +1 = 1. The k -dimensional affine subspaces of R n are in one-to-one correspondence with the ( k + 1 )-dimensional linear subspaces of R n +1 that are in general position with respect to the plane x n +1 = 1. Indeed, a k -dimensional affine subspace of R n is the locus of solutions of a rank n − k system of affine equations a 11 x 1 + ⋯ + a 1 n x n = a 1 , n + 1 ⋮ a n − k , 1 x 1 + ⋯ + a n − k , n x n = a n − k , n + 1 . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}a_{11}x_{1}+\cdots +a_{1n}x_{n}&=a_{1,n+1}\\&\vdots &\\a_{n-k,1}x_{1}+\cdots +a_{n-k,n}x_{n}&=a_{n-k,n+1}.\end{aligned}}} These determine a rank n − k system of linear equations on R n +1 a 11 x 1 + ⋯ + a 1 n x n = a 1 , n + 1 x n + 1 ⋮ a n − k , 1 x 1 + ⋯ + a n − k , n x n = a n − k , n + 1 x n + 1 . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}a_{11}x_{1}+\cdots +a_{1n}x_{n}&=a_{1,n+1}x_{n+1}\\&\vdots &\\a_{n-k,1}x_{1}+\cdots +a_{n-k,n}x_{n}&=a_{n-k,n+1}x_{n+1}.\end{aligned}}} whose solution is a ( k + 1)-plane that, when intersected with x n +1 = 1, is the original k -plane. Because of this identification, Graff( k , n ) is a Zariski open set in Gr( k + 1, n + 1).

[1] The special case of a 1-dimensional algebra is known as a dual number . Grassmann numbers saw an early use in physics to express a path integral representation for fermionic fields , although they are now widely used as a foundation for superspace , on which supersymmetry is constructed. Informal discussion [ edit ] Grassmann numbers are generated by anti-commuting elements or objects. The idea of anti-commuting objects arises in multiple areas of mathematics: they are typically seen in differential geometry , where the differential forms are anti-commuting. Differential forms are normally defined in terms of derivatives on a manifold; however, one can contemplate the situation where one ""forgets"" or ""ignores"" the existence of any underlying manifold, and ""forgets"" or ""ignores"" that the forms were defined as derivatives, and instead, simply contemplate a situation where one has objects that anti-commute, and have no other pre-defined or presupposed properties. Such objects form an algebra , and specifically the Grassmann algebra or exterior algebra. The Grassmann numbers are elements of that algebra. The appellation of ""number"" is justified by the fact that they behave not unlike ""ordinary"" numbers: they can be added, multiplied and divided: they behave almost like a field . More can be done: one can consider polynomials of Grassmann numbers, leading to the idea of holomorphic functions . One can take derivatives of such functions, and then consider the anti-derivatives as well. Each of these ideas can be carefully defined, and correspond reasonably well to the equivalent concepts from ordinary mathematics. The analogy does not stop there: one has an entire branch of supermathematics , where the analog of Euclidean space is superspace , the analog of a manifold is a supermanifold , the analog of a Lie algebra is a Lie superalgebra and so on. The Grassmann numbers are the underlying construct that make this all possible. Of course, one could pursue a similar program for any other field, or even ring , and this is indeed widely and commonly done in mathematics. However, supermathematics takes on a special significance in physics, because the anti-commuting behavior can be strongly identified with the quantum-mechanical behavior of fermions: the anti-commutation is that of the Pauli exclusion principle . Thus, the study of Grassmann numbers, and of supermathematics, in general, is strongly driven by their utility in physics. Specifically, in quantum field theory , or more narrowly, second quantization , one works with ladder operators that create multi-particle quantum states. The ladder operators for fermions create field quanta that must necessarily have anti-symmetric wave functions , as this is forced by the Pauli exclusion principle. In this situation, a Grassmann number corresponds immediately and directly to a wave function that contains some (typically indeterminate) number of fermions. When the number of fermions is fixed and finite, an explicit relationship between anticommutation relations and spinors is given by means of the spin group . This group can be defined as the subset of unit-length vectors in the Clifford algebra , and naturally factorizes into anti-commuting Weyl spinors . Both the anti-commutation and the expression as spinors arises in a natural fashion for the spin group. In essence, the Grassmann numbers can be thought of as discarding the relationships arising from spin, and keeping only the relationships due to anti-commutation. General description and properties [ edit ] Grassmann numbers are individual elements or points of the exterior algebra generated by a set of n Grassmann variables or Grassmann directions or supercharges { θ i } {\displaystyle \{\theta _{i}\}} , with n possibly being infinite. The usage of the term ""Grassmann variables"" is historic; they are not variables, per se ; they are better understood as the basis elements of a unital algebra . The terminology comes from the fact that a primary use is to define integrals, and that the variable of integration is Grassmann-valued, and thus, by abuse of language, is called a Grassmann variable. Similarly, the notion of direction comes from the notion of superspace , where ordinary Euclidean space is extended with additional Grassmann-valued ""directions"". The appellation of charge comes from the notion of charges in physics , which correspond to the generators of physical symmetries (via Noether's theorem ). The perceived symmetry is that multiplication by a single Grassmann variable swaps the Z 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} _{2}} grading between fermions and bosons; this is discussed in greater detail below. The Grassmann variables are the basis vectors of a vector space (of dimension n ). They form an algebra over a field , with the field usually being taken to be the complex numbers , although one could contemplate other fields, such as the reals. The algebra is a unital algebra , and the generators are anti-commuting: θ i θ j = − θ j θ i {\displaystyle \theta _{i}\theta _{j}=-\theta _{j}\theta _{i}} Since the θ i {\displaystyle \theta _{i}} are elements of a vector space over the complex numbers, they, by definition, commute with complex numbers. That is, for complex x , one has θ i x = x θ i . {\displaystyle \theta _{i}x=x\theta _{i}.} The squares of the generators vanish: ( θ i ) 2 = 0 , {\displaystyle (\theta _{i})^{2}=0,} since θ i θ i = − θ i θ i . {\displaystyle \theta _{i}\theta _{i}=-\theta _{i}\theta _{i}.} In other words, a Grassmann variable is a non-zero square-root of zero. Formal definition [ edit ] Formally, let V be an n -dimensional complex vector space with basis θ i , i = 1 , … , n {\displaystyle \theta _{i},i=1,\ldots ,n} . The Grassmann algebra whose Grassmann variables are θ i , i = 1 , … , n {\displaystyle \theta _{i},i=1,\ldots ,n} is defined to be the exterior algebra of V , namely Λ ( V ) = C ⊕ V ⊕ ( V ∧ V ) ⊕ ( V ∧ V ∧ V ) ⊕ ⋯ ⊕ ( V ∧ V ∧ ⋯ ∧ V ) ⏟ n ≡ C ⊕ Λ 1 V ⊕ Λ 2 V ⊕ ⋯ ⊕ Λ n V , {\displaystyle \Lambda (V)=\mathbb {C} \oplus V\oplus \left(V\wedge V\right)\oplus \left(V\wedge V\wedge V\right)\oplus \cdots \oplus \underbrace {\left(V\wedge V\wedge \cdots \wedge V\right)} _{n}\equiv \mathbb {C} \oplus \Lambda ^{1}V\oplus \Lambda ^{2}V\oplus \cdots \oplus \Lambda ^{n}V,} where ∧ {\displaystyle \wedge } is the exterior product and ⊕ {\displaystyle \oplus } is the direct sum . The individual elements of this algebra are then called Grassmann numbers . It is standard to omit the wedge symbol ∧ {\displaystyle \wedge } when writing a Grassmann number once the definition is established. A general Grassmann number can be written as z = c 0 + ∑ k = 1 n ∑ i 1 , i 2 , ⋯ , i k c i 1 i 2 ⋯ i k θ i 1 θ i 2 ⋯ θ i k , {\displaystyle z=c_{0}+\sum _{k=1}^{n}\sum _{i_{1},i_{2},\cdots ,i_{k}}c_{i_{1}i_{2}\cdots i_{k}}\theta _{i_{1}}\theta _{i_{2}}\cdots \theta _{i_{k}},} where ( i 1 , i 2 , … , i k ) {\displaystyle (i_{1},i_{2},\ldots ,i_{k})} are strictly increasing k -tuples with 1 ≤ i j ≤ n , 1 ≤ j ≤ k {\displaystyle 1\leq i_{j}\leq n,1\leq j\leq k} , and the c i 1 i 2 ⋯ i k {\displaystyle c_{i_{1}i_{2}\cdots i_{k}}} are complex, completely antisymmetric tensors of rank k . Again, the θ i {\displaystyle \theta _{i}} , and the θ i ∧ θ j = θ i θ j {\displaystyle \theta _{i}\wedge \theta _{j}=\theta _{i}\theta _{j}} (subject to i < j {\displaystyle i<j} ), and larger finite products, can be seen here to be playing the role of a basis vectors of subspaces of Λ {\displaystyle \Lambda } . The Grassmann algebra generated by n linearly independent Grassmann variables has dimension 2 n ; this follows from the binomial theorem applied to the above sum, and the fact that the ( n + 1) -fold product of variables must vanish, by the anti-commutation relations, above. The dimension of Λ k V {\displaystyle \Lambda ^{k}V} is given by n choose k , the binomial coefficient . The special case of n = 1 is called a dual number , and was introduced by William Clifford in 1873. In case V is infinite-dimensional, the above series does not terminate and one defines Λ ∞ ( V ) = C ⊕ Λ 1 V ⊕ Λ 2 V ⊕ ⋯ . {\displaystyle \Lambda _{\infty }(V)=\mathbb {C} \oplus \Lambda ^{1}V\oplus \Lambda ^{2}V\oplus \cdots .} The general element is now z = ∑ k = 0 ∞ ∑ i 1 , i 2 , ⋯ , i k 1 k ! c i 1 i 2 ⋯ i k θ i 1 θ i 2 ⋯ θ i k ≡ z B + z S = z B + ∑ k = 1 ∞ ∑ i 1 , i 2 , ⋯ , i k 1 k ! c i 1 i 2 ⋯ i k θ i 1 θ i 2 ⋯ θ i k , {\displaystyle z=\sum _{k=0}^{\infty }\sum _{i_{1},i_{2},\cdots ,i_{k}}{\frac {1}{k!}}c_{i_{1}i_{2}\cdots i_{k}}\theta _{i_{1}}\theta _{i_{2}}\cdots \theta _{i_{k}}\equiv z_{B}+z_{S}=z_{B}+\sum _{k=1}^{\infty }\sum _{i_{1},i_{2},\cdots ,i_{k}}{\frac {1}{k!}}c_{i_{1}i_{2}\cdots i_{k}}\theta _{i_{1}}\theta _{i_{2}}\cdots \theta _{i_{k}},} where z B {\displaystyle z_{B}} is sometimes referred to as the body and z S {\displaystyle z_{S}} as the soul of the supernumber z {\displaystyle z} . Properties [ edit ] In the finite-dimensional case (using the same terminology) the soul is nilpotent , i.e. z S n + 1 = 0 , {\displaystyle z_{S}^{n+1}=0,} but this is not necessarily so in the infinite-dimensional case. [2] If V is finite-dimensional, then θ i z = 0 , 1 ≤ i ≤ n ⇒ z = c θ 1 θ 2 ⋯ θ n , c ∈ C , {\displaystyle \theta _{i}z=0,\quad 1\leq i\leq n\Rightarrow z=c\theta _{1}\theta _{2}\cdots \theta _{n},\quad c\in \mathbb {C} ,} and if V is infinite-dimensional [3] θ a z = 0 ∀ a ⇒ z = 0. {\displaystyle \theta _{a}z=0\quad \forall a\Rightarrow z=0.} Finite vs. countable sets of generators [ edit ] Two distinct kinds of supernumbers commonly appear in the literature: those with a finite number of generators, typically n = 1, 2, 3 or 4, and those with a countably-infinite number of generators. These two situations are not as unrelated as they may seem at first. First, in the definition of a supermanifold , one variant uses a countably-infinite number of generators, but then employs a topology that effectively reduces the dimension to a small finite number. [4] [5] In the other case, one may start with a finite number of generators, but in the course of second quantization , a need for an infinite number of generators arises: one each for every possible momentum that a fermion might carry. Involution, choice of field [ edit ] The complex numbers are usually chosen as the field for the definition of the Grassmann numbers, as opposed to the real numbers, as this avoids some strange behaviors when a conjugation or involution is introduced. It is common to introduce an operator * on the Grassmann numbers such that: θ = θ ∗ {\displaystyle \theta =\theta ^{*}} when θ {\displaystyle \theta } is a generator, and such that ( θ i θ j ⋯ θ k ) ∗ = θ k ⋯ θ j θ i {\displaystyle (\theta _{i}\theta _{j}\cdots \theta _{k})^{*}=\theta _{k}\cdots \theta _{j}\theta _{i}} One may then consider Grassmann numbers z for which z = z ∗ {\displaystyle z=z^{*}} , and term these (super) real , while those that obey z ∗ = − z {\displaystyle z^{*}=-z} are termed (super) imaginary . These definitions carry through just fine, even if the Grassmann numbers use the real numbers as the base field; however, in such a case, many coefficients are forced to vanish if the number of generators is less than 4. Thus, by convention, the Grassmann numbers are usually defined over the complex numbers. Other conventions are possible; the above is sometimes referred to as the DeWitt convention; Rogers employs θ ∗ = i θ {\displaystyle \theta ^{*}=i\theta } for the involution. In this convention, the real supernumbers always have real coefficients; whereas in the DeWitt convention, the real supernumbers may have both real and imaginary coefficients. Despite this, it is usually easiest to work with the DeWitt convention. Analysis [ edit ] Products of an odd number of Grassmann variables anti-commute with each other; such a product is often called an a-number . Products of an even number of Grassmann variables commute (with all Grassman numbers); they are often called c-number s. By abuse of terminology, an a-number is sometimes called an anticommuting c-number . This decomposition into even and odd subspaces provides a Z 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} _{2}} grading on the algebra; thus Grassmann algebras are the prototypical examples of supercommutative algebras . Note that the c-numbers form a subalgebra of Λ {\displaystyle \Lambda } , but the a-numbers do not (they are a subspace, not a subalgebra). The definition of Grassmann numbers allows mathematical analysis to be performed, in analogy to analysis on complex numbers. That is, one may define superholomorphic functions , define derivatives, as well as defining integrals. Some of the basic concepts are developed in greater detail in the article on dual numbers . As a general rule, it is usually easier to define the super-symmetric analogs of ordinary mathematical entities by working with Grassmann numbers with an infinite number of generators: most definitions become straightforward, and can be taken over from the corresponding bosonic definitions. For example, a single Grassmann number can be thought of as generating a one-dimensional space. A vector space, the m -dimensional superspace , then appears as the m -fold Cartesian product of these one-dimensional Λ . {\displaystyle \Lambda .} [ clarification needed ] It can be shown that this is essentially equivalent to an algebra with m generators, but this requires work. [6] [ clarification needed ] Spinor space [ edit ] The spinor space is defined as the Grassmann or exterior algebra ⋀ W {\displaystyle \textstyle {\bigwedge }W} of the space of Weyl spinors W {\displaystyle W} (and anti-spinors W ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {W}}} ), such that the wave functions of n fermions belong in ⋀ n W {\displaystyle \textstyle {\bigwedge }^{n}W} . Integration [ edit ] Main article: Berezin integral Integrals over Grassmann numbers are known as Berezin integrals (sometimes called Grassmann integrals). In order to reproduce the path integral for a Fermi field, the definition of Grassmann integration needs to have the following properties: linearity ∫ [ a f ( θ ) + b g ( θ ) ] d θ = a ∫ f ( θ ) d θ + b ∫ g ( θ ) d θ {\displaystyle \int \,[af(\theta )+bg(\theta )]\,d\theta =a\int \,f(\theta )\,d\theta +b\int \,g(\theta )\,d\theta } partial integration formula ∫ [ ∂ ∂ θ f ( θ ) ] d θ = 0. {\displaystyle \int \left[{\frac {\partial }{\partial \theta }}f(\theta )\right]\,d\theta =0.} Moreover, the Taylor expansion of any function f ( θ ) = A + B θ {\displaystyle f(\theta )=A+B\theta } terminates after two terms because θ 2 = 0 {\displaystyle \theta ^{2}=0} , and quantum field theory additionally require invariance under the shift of integration variables θ → θ + η {\displaystyle \theta \to \theta +\eta } such that ∫ d θ f ( θ ) = ∫ d θ ( A + B θ ) ≡ ∫ d θ ( ( A + B η ) + B θ ) . {\displaystyle \int d\theta f(\theta )=\int d\theta (A+B\theta )\equiv \int d\theta ((A+B\eta )+B\theta ).} The only linear function satisfying this condition is a constant (conventionally 1) times B , so Berezin defined [7] ∫ d θ ( A + B θ ) ≡ B . {\displaystyle \int d\theta (A+B\theta )\equiv B.} This results in the following rules for the integration of a Grassmann quantity: ∫ 1 d θ = 0 {\displaystyle \int \,1\,d\theta =0} ∫ θ d θ = 1. {\displaystyle \int \,\theta \,d\theta =1.} Thus we conclude that the operations of integration and differentiation of a Grassmann number are identical. In the path integral formulation of quantum field theory the following Gaussian integral of Grassmann quantities is needed for fermionic anticommuting fields, with A being an N × N matrix: ∫ exp ⁡ [ − θ T A η ] d θ d η = det A {\displaystyle \int \exp \left[-\theta ^{\rm {T}}A\eta \right]\,d\theta \,d\eta =\det A} . Conventions and complex integration [ edit ] An ambiguity arises when integrating over multiple Grassmann numbers. The convention that performs the innermost integral first yields ∫ d θ ∫ d η η θ = + 1. {\displaystyle \int d\theta \int d\eta \;\eta \theta =+1.} Some authors also define complex conjugation similar to Hermitian conjugation of operators, [8] ( θ η ) ∗ ≡ η ∗ θ ∗ = − θ ∗ η ∗ . {\displaystyle (\theta \eta )^{*}\equiv \eta ^{*}\theta ^{*}=-\theta ^{*}\eta ^{*}.} With the additional convention θ = θ 1 + i θ 2 2 , θ ∗ = θ 1 − i θ 2 2 , {\displaystyle \theta ={\frac {\theta _{1}+i\theta _{2}}{\sqrt {2}}},\quad \theta ^{*}={\frac {\theta _{1}-i\theta _{2}}{\sqrt {2}}},} we can treat θ and θ* as independent Grassmann numbers, and adopt ∫ d θ ∗ d θ ( θ θ ∗ ) = 1. {\displaystyle \int d\theta ^{*}d\theta \,(\theta \theta ^{*})=1.} Thus a Gaussian integral evaluates to ∫ d θ ∗ d θ e − θ ∗ b θ = ∫ d θ ∗ d θ ( 1 − θ ∗ b θ ) = ∫ d θ ∗ d θ ( 1 + θ θ ∗ b ) = b {\displaystyle \int d\theta ^{*}d\theta \,e^{-\theta ^{*}b\theta }=\int d\theta ^{*}d\theta \,(1-\theta ^{*}b\theta )=\int d\theta ^{*}d\theta \,(1+\theta \theta ^{*}b)=b} and an extra factor of θθ* effectively introduces a factor of (1/b) , just like an ordinary Gaussian, ∫ d θ ∗ d θ θ θ ∗ e − θ ∗ b θ = 1. {\displaystyle \int d\theta ^{*}d\theta \,\theta \theta ^{*}\,e^{-\theta ^{*}b\theta }=1.} After proving unitarity, we can evaluate a general Gaussian integral involving a Hermitian matrix B with eigenvalues b i , [8] [9] ( ∏ i ∫ d θ i ∗ d θ i ) e − θ i ∗ B i j θ j = ( ∏ i ∫ d θ i ∗ d θ i ) e − θ i ∗ b i θ i = ∏ i b i = det B . {\displaystyle \left(\prod _{i}\int d\theta _{i}^{*}\,d\theta _{i}\right)e^{-\theta _{i}^{*}B_{ij}\theta _{j}}=\left(\prod _{i}\int d\theta _{i}^{*}\,d\theta _{i}\right)e^{-\theta _{i}^{*}b_{i}\theta _{i}}=\prod _{i}b_{i}=\det B.} Matrix representations [ edit ] Grassmann numbers can be represented by matrices . Consider, for example, the Grassmann algebra generated by two Grassmann numbers θ 1 {\displaystyle \theta _{1}} and θ 2 {\displaystyle \theta _{2}} . These Grassmann numbers can be represented by 4×4 matrices: θ 1 = [ 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 ] θ 2 = [ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 − 1 0 0 ] θ 1 θ 2 = − θ 2 θ 1 = [ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 ] . {\displaystyle \theta _{1}={\begin{bmatrix}0&0&0&0\\1&0&0&0\\0&0&0&0\\0&0&1&0\end{bmatrix}}\qquad \theta _{2}={\begin{bmatrix}0&0&0&0\\0&0&0&0\\1&0&0&0\\0&-1&0&0\end{bmatrix}}\qquad \theta _{1}\theta _{2}=-\theta _{2}\theta _{1}={\begin{bmatrix}0&0&0&0\\0&0&0&0\\0&0&0&0\\1&0&0&0\end{bmatrix}}.} In general, a Grassmann algebra on n generators can be represented by 2 n × 2 n square matrices. Physically, these matrices can be thought of as raising operators acting on a Hilbert space of n identical fermions in the occupation number basis. Since the occupation number for each fermion is 0 or 1, there are 2 n possible basis states. Mathematically, these matrices can be interpreted as the linear operators corresponding to left exterior multiplication on the Grassmann algebra itself. Generalisations [ edit ] There are some generalisations to Grassmann numbers. These require rules in terms of N variables such that: θ i 1 θ i 2 ⋯ θ i N + θ i N θ i 1 θ i 2 ⋯ + ⋯ = 0 {\displaystyle \theta _{i_{1}}\theta _{i_{2}}\cdots \theta _{i_{N}}+\theta _{i_{N}}\theta _{i_{1}}\theta _{i_{2}}\cdots +\cdots =0} where the indices are summed over all permutations so that as a consequence: ( θ i ) N = 0 {\displaystyle (\theta _{i})^{N}=0\,} for some N > 2. These are useful for calculating hyperdeterminants of N -tensors where N > 2 and also for calculating discriminants of polynomials for powers larger than 2. There is also the limiting case as N tends to infinity in which case one can define analytic functions on the numbers. For example, in the case with N = 3 a single Grassmann number can be represented by the matrix: θ = [ 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 ] {\displaystyle \theta ={\begin{bmatrix}0&1&0\\0&0&1\\0&0&0\end{bmatrix}}\qquad } so that θ 3 = 0 {\displaystyle \theta ^{3}=0} . For two Grassmann numbers the matrix would be of size 10×10. For example, the rules for N = 3 with two Grassmann variables imply: θ 1 ( θ 2 ) 2 + θ 2 θ 1 θ 2 + ( θ 2 ) 2 θ 1 = 0 {\displaystyle \theta _{1}(\theta _{2})^{2}+\theta _{2}\theta _{1}\theta _{2}+(\theta _{2})^{2}\theta _{1}=0} so that it can be shown that θ 1 ( θ 2 ) 2 = − 1 2 θ 2 θ 1 θ 2 = ( θ 2 ) 2 θ 1 {\displaystyle \theta _{1}(\theta _{2})^{2}=-{\frac {1}{2}}\theta _{2}\theta _{1}\theta _{2}=(\theta _{2})^{2}\theta _{1}} and so ( θ 1 ) 2 ( θ 2 ) 2 = ( θ 2 ) 2 ( θ 1 ) 2 = θ 1 ( θ 2 ) 2 θ 1 = θ 2 ( θ 1 ) 2 θ 2 = − 1 2 θ 1 θ 2 θ 1 θ 2 = − 1 2 θ 2 θ 1 θ 2 θ 1 , {\displaystyle (\theta _{1})^{2}(\theta _{2})^{2}=(\theta _{2})^{2}(\theta _{1})^{2}=\theta _{1}(\theta _{2})^{2}\theta _{1}=\theta _{2}(\theta _{1})^{2}\theta _{2}=-{\frac {1}{2}}\theta _{1}\theta _{2}\theta _{1}\theta _{2}=-{\frac {1}{2}}\theta _{2}\theta _{1}\theta _{2}\theta _{1},} which gives a definition for the hyperdeterminant of a 2×2×2 tensor as ( A a b c θ a η b ψ c ) 4 = det ( A ) ( θ 1 ) 2 ( θ 2 ) 2 ( η 1 ) 2 ( η 2 ) 2 ( ψ 1 ) 2 ( ψ 2 ) 2 . {\displaystyle (A^{abc}\theta _{a}\eta _{b}\psi _{c})^{4}=\det(A)(\theta _{1})^{2}(\theta _{2})^{2}(\eta _{1})^{2}(\eta _{2})^{2}(\psi _{1})^{2}(\psi _{2})^{2}.} See also [ edit ] Grassmannian Hermann Grassmann (linguist and mathematician) Superspace Exterior algebra Notes [ edit ] ^ DeWitt 1984 , Chapter 1, page 1. ^ DeWitt 1984 , pp. 1–2. ^ DeWitt 1984 , p. 2. ^ Rogers 2007a , Chapter 1 (available online) ^ Rogers 2007 , Chapter 1 and Chapter 8. ^ Rogers 2007 ^ Berezin, F.

In mathematics , the affine Grassmannian of an algebraic group G over a field k is an ind-scheme —a colimit of finite-dimensional schemes —which can be thought of as a flag variety for the loop group G ( k (( t ))) and which describes the representation theory of the Langlands dual group L G through what is known as the geometric Satake correspondence . Definition of Gr via functor of points [ edit ] Let k be a field, and denote by k -Alg {\displaystyle k{\text{-Alg}}} and S e t {\displaystyle \mathrm {Set} } the category of commutative k -algebras and the category of sets respectively. Through the Yoneda lemma , a scheme X over a field k is determined by its functor of points , which is the functor X : k -Alg → S e t {\displaystyle X:k{\text{-Alg}}\to \mathrm {Set} } which takes A to the set X ( A ) of A -points of X . We then say that this functor is representable by the scheme X . The affine Grassmannian is a functor from k -algebras to sets which is not itself representable, but which has a filtration by representable functors. As such, although it is not a scheme, it may be thought of as a union of schemes, and this is enough to profitably apply geometric methods to study it. Let G be an algebraic group over k . The affine Grassmannian Gr G is the functor that associates to a k -algebra A the set of isomorphism classes of pairs ( E , φ ), where E is a principal homogeneous space for G over Spec A [[ t ]] and φ is an isomorphism, defined over Spec A (( t )), of E with the trivial G -bundle G × Spec A (( t )). By the Beauville–Laszlo theorem , it is also possible to specify this data by fixing an algebraic curve X over k , a k -point x on X , and taking E to be a G -bundle on X A and φ a trivialization on ( X − x ) A . When G is a reductive group , Gr G is in fact ind-projective, i.e., an inductive limit of projective schemes. Definition as a coset space [ edit ] Let us denote by K = k ( ( t ) ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {K}}=k((t))} the field of formal Laurent series over k , and by O = k [ [ t ] ] {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}=k[[t]]} the ring of formal power series over k . By choosing a trivialization of E over all of Spec ⁡ O {\displaystyle \operatorname {Spec} {\mathcal {O}}} , the set of k -points of Gr G is identified with the coset space G ( K ) / G ( O ) {\displaystyle G({\mathcal {K}})/G({\mathcal {O}})} .

Discovered by Hermann Grassmann [1] these ""laws"" are actually principles used to predict color match responses to a good approximation under photopic and mesopic vision. A number of studies have examined how and why they provide poor predictions under specific conditions. [2] [3] Modern interpretation [ edit ] Grassmann expressed his first law with respect to a circular arrangement of spectral colors in this 1853 illustration. [4] The four laws are described in modern texts [5] with varying degrees of algebraic notation and are summarized as follows (the precise numbering and corollary definitions can vary across sources [6] ): First law : Two colored lights appear different if they differ in either dominant wavelength, luminance or purity . Corollary: For every colored light there exists a light with a complementary color such that a mixture of both lights either desaturates the more intense component or gives uncolored (grey/white) light. Second law : The appearance of a mixture of light made from two components changes if either component changes. Corollary: A mixture of two colored lights that are non-complementary result in a mixture that varies in hue with relative intensities of each light and in saturation according to the distance between the hues of each light. Third law : There are lights with different spectral power distributions but appear identical. First corollary: such identical appearing lights must have identical effects when added to a mixture of light. Second corollary: such identical appearing lights must have identical effects when subtracted (i.e., filtered) from a mixture of light. Fourth law : The intensity of a mixture of lights is the sum of the intensities of the components. This is also known as Abney's law . These laws entail an algebraic representation of colored light. [7] Assuming beam 1 and 2 each have a color, and the observer chooses ( R 1 , G 1 , B 1 ) {\displaystyle (R_{1},G_{1},B_{1})} as the strengths of the primaries that match beam 1 and ( R 2 , G 2 , B 2 ) {\displaystyle (R_{2},G_{2},B_{2})} as the strengths of the primaries that match beam 2, then if the two beams were combined, the matching values will be the sums of the components. Precisely, they will be ( R , G , B ) {\displaystyle (R,G,B)} , where: R = R 1 + R 2 {\displaystyle R=R_{1}+R_{2}\,} G = G 1 + G 2 {\displaystyle G=G_{1}+G_{2}\,} B = B 1 + B 2 {\displaystyle B=B_{1}+B_{2}\,} Grassmann's laws can be expressed in general form by stating that for a given color with a spectral power distribution I ( λ ) {\displaystyle I(\lambda )} the RGB coordinates are given by: R = ∫ 0 ∞ I ( λ ) r ¯ ( λ ) d λ {\displaystyle R=\int _{0}^{\infty }I(\lambda )\,{\bar {r}}(\lambda )\,d\lambda } G = ∫ 0 ∞ I ( λ ) g ¯ ( λ ) d λ {\displaystyle G=\int _{0}^{\infty }I(\lambda )\,{\bar {g}}(\lambda )\,d\lambda } B = ∫ 0 ∞ I ( λ ) b ¯ ( λ ) d λ {\displaystyle B=\int _{0}^{\infty }I(\lambda )\,{\bar {b}}(\lambda )\,d\lambda } Observe that these are linear in I {\displaystyle I} ; the functions r ¯ ( λ ) , g ¯ ( λ ) , b ¯ ( λ ) {\displaystyle {\bar {r}}(\lambda ),{\bar {g}}(\lambda ),{\bar {b}}(\lambda )} are the color matching functions with respect to the chosen primaries.

Using Math When using math in an article, there are two different types of markup that one can use. It is important to be consistent throughout an article and use the same type of markup. If a formula appears all on the same line, it would be better to use HTML than LaTeX, because L ∞ looks better in line than L ∞ {\displaystyle L^{\infty }} does; however it's generally a bad idea to attempt to render Q ( x ) = 1 2 π ∫ x ∞ e − t 2 / 2 d t = 1 2 erfc ⁡ ( x 2 ) , x ≥ 0 {\displaystyle Q(x)={\frac {1}{\sqrt {2\pi }}}\int _{x}^{\infty }e^{-t^{2}/2}dt={\frac {1}{2}}\,\operatorname {erfc} \left({\frac {x}{\sqrt {2}}}\right),\ x\geq {}0} in HTML.

They are implemented by a MediaWiki feature that adds any page with a text like [[Category: XYZ ]] in its wiki markup to the automated listing that is the category with name XYZ . Categories help readers to find, and navigate around, a subject area, to see pages sorted by title, and to thus find article relationships. Categories are normally found at the bottom of an article page. Clicking a category name brings up a category page listing the articles (or other pages) that have been added to that particular category. There may also be a section listing the subcategories of that category. The subcategorization feature makes it possible to organize categories into tree-like structures to aid navigation. The term category does refer to both the title of a category page—the category pagename —and the category itself. Keeping this in mind while reading about categorization, plus learning a category page layout is a worthwhile investment in research techniques. (See also the search box parameter "" incategory "".) The layout of a category page is mostly text, but see about displaying category trees below. Summary The MediaWiki software maintains tables of categories , to which any editable page can be added. To add a page to a category, include "" [[Category: Category name ]] "" or "" [[Category: Category name | Sortkey ]] "" in that page's wiki markup . The categories to which a page belongs appear in a box at the bottom of the page. A category is usually associated with a category page in the ""Category:"" namespace . [1] A category page contains text that can be edited, like any other page, but when the page is displayed, the last part of what is displayed is an automatically generated list of all pages in that category, in the form of links. Other category pages which appear in this list are treated separately, as subcategories . The bottom of a Wikipedia article on Chicken eyeglasses . At the very bottom of the page, below the References, navigation templates and external links are a series of links. These links are the categories used on the page, which include: Category:Animal welfare , Category:Animal equipment , Category:Eyewear , and Category:Poultry farming . By clicking on the category link at the bottom of the page, readers can navigate the Category tree. Category page definition A category page is any page in the Category namespace. They each act as a category, and are termed a ""category"". The category page has one section titled Subcategories listing other ""categories"", and one section titled Pages , listing pages as categorized (in other namespaces). New categories are created by creating a page in the Category namespace. A category page can be edited like any other page. However, when it is displayed, the editable part of the page is followed by automatically generated lists of pages belonging to the category, as follows: First a count and list of subcategories (other category pages belonging to the category) is shown, if any exist. The name of each subcategory is followed by counts like ""(6 C, 38 P, 2 F)"", meaning this subcategory contains 6 subcategories, 38 pages, and 2 files. Counts of 0 are omitted. The further subcategories are expanded in the display if the ► sign alongside the subcategory is clicked (but this "" widget "" is only visible if your browser has JavaScript enabled). Note: ► is shown if there are no further subcategories. The subcategory is collapsed again if ▼ is clicked. Next a count and list of pages in the category (excluding subcategories and images) is shown. If the category has no members, a message to that effect is displayed. Next a count and list of image and other media files in the category appears, if any exist. These are shown with thumbnails. The first 20 characters of the file name are shown, with an ellipsis if that is not the full name; also the file size is shown. The items in the lists all link to the pages concerned; in the case of the images this applies both to the image itself and to the text below it (the name of the image). For the way in which the lists are ordered, see Sorting category pages below. The first and second lists are divided into sections, according to the first character of the sort key. These initial characters are displayed above the sections. To suppress these, make all sort keys start with a space. A category page can only display a limited number of items (currently 200). If more pages belong to the category, there will be a link to the next ones. The categories box for the category page appears at the bottom, in the same place as for other pages. This contains the categories to which the current category page has been added, i.e., its parent categories (the categories of which it is a subcategory). Add a category page to other categories in the normal way, using the ""[[Category: Category name ]]"" or ""[[Category: Category name | Sortkey ]]"" syntax. Putting pages into categories Shortcut WP:PAGECAT A page becomes part of a category if the page's wiki markup contains a declaration for that category. A category declaration takes the form [[Category: Category name ]] or [[Category: Category name | Sortkey ]] . The declaration must be processed, i.e. it will not work if it appears between <nowiki>...</nowiki> or <includeonly>...</includeonly> tags, or in a comment. The declaration may however come from a transcluded page; see Categories and templates below. A category name can be any string that would be a legitimate page title . If the category name begins with a lower-case letter, it will be capitalized. For initial lower-case letters, as in Category:macOS , see the technical restrictions page. On Wikipedia, it is customary to place category declarations at the end of the wiki markup, but before any stub templates (which themselves transclude categories) and interlanguage links . When a page has been added to one or more categories, a categories box appears at the bottom of the page (or possibly elsewhere, if a non-default skin is being used). This box contains a list of the categories the page belongs to, in the order in which the category declarations appear in the processed wiki markup. The category names are linked to the corresponding category pages. They appear as red links if the corresponding category page does not exist. If a user has enabled the HotCat gadget, the categories box will also provide links to quickly add, remove, or modify category declarations on the page, without having to edit the whole page. Hidden categories are not displayed, except as described below under Hiding categories . Working with category pages The following subsections are ordered from simple actions to more elaborate or rarer actions. Linking to category pages To link to a category page without putting the current page in that category, precede the link with a colon: [[:Category: Category name ]]. Such a link can be piped like a normal wikilink. (The {{ cl }} template, and others listed on its documentation page, may sometimes be helpful.) Retrieving raw category information Raw information about the members of a category, their sort keys and timestamps (time when last added to the category) can be obtained from the API , using a query of the form: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?cmtitle=Category: Category_name &action=query&list=categorymembers&cmlimit=500&cmprop=title|sortkey|timestamp Listings of up to 500 members are possible. If there are more members then the results will include text near the end like this: <categorymembers cmcontinue= ""page|NNNN|TITLE"" /> . This can be added to the previous one, without quotation marks, for the next page of members: ...&cmcontinue=page|NNNN|TITLE Sorting category pages Shortcut WP:SORTCAT By default, a page is sorted under the first character of its name, without the namespace. English Wikipedia groups accented characters together with their unaccented version, so pages starting with À, Á, Ä, will be listed under heading A. Sorting is case-insensitive, so ""ABC"" comes after ""Abacus"". Unlike at Special:Allpages and Special:Prefixindex , a space is treated as a space (coming before all other characters), not as an underscore. The English Wikipedia has numerical sorting in categories . This means a page whose title begins with a number will be sorted according to the numeric value of the number (even if it is multiple digits). Thus ""9 dogs"", ""25 dogs"", and ""112 dogs"" will all appear under the ""0–9"" heading in numeric order. If the number includes a comma, space, or period, the sorting algorithm will only consider the part of the number before the separator. Each of the three lists (subcategories, pages, media files) is arranged in the order explained above (except that, in the subcategories list, the namespace indicator ""Category:"" is not considered). If an item ought to be positioned within a list on the basis of an alternative name (sort key) for that item, then this can be specified in the category tag that places the item in the list: [[Category: Category name | Sortkey ]] For example, to add an article called Albert Einstein to Category:1879 births and have the article sorted by ""Einstein, Albert"", you would type: [[Category:1879 births|Einstein, Albert]] Unlike a piped link (which uses the same syntax), the sort key itself is not displayed to readers. It affects only the order in which pages are listed on the category page. It is useful to document the system being used for sort keys on the category page. For guidelines about the use of sort keys on Wikipedia, see WP:SORTKEY . Default sort key Shortcut WP:DEFAULTSORT This section documents functionality. For guidelines, see WP:NAMESORT and WP:SORTKEY . It is possible to set a default sort key which is different from {{PAGENAME}} by using the magic word {{DEFAULTSORT:}} : {{DEFAULTSORT:new key}} This is often used in biography articles, to make sure the subject is sorted by their last name: {{DEFAULTSORT:LastName, FirstName}} For example, on the Albert Einstein page, {{DEFAULTSORT:Einstein, Albert}} adds the sort key ""Einstein, Albert"" to all his categories, such as Category:1879 births . In the case of multiple default sort key tags, the last DEFAULTSORT on the final rendering of a page applies for all categories, regardless of the position of the category tags. This also means that a DEFAULTSORT tag included from a template is not effective if another DEFAULTSORT tag occurs later on the page, even if the later DEFAULTSORT tag is also ""hidden"" (included by another template). If a category is added inside <ref>...</ref> then DEFAULTSORT may be ignored . Searching for pages in categories Further information: Help:Searching § Syntax See also: § Searching for articles in categories , Wikipedia:Category intersection , and Wikimedia bug T3497 ""Hierarchical category system is urgently needed"" In addition to browsing through hierarchies of categories, it is possible to use the search tool to find specific articles in specific categories. To search for articles in a specific category, type incategory:"" CategoryName "" in the search box. A pipe ""|"" can be added to join the contents of one category with the contents of another. For example, enter incategory:""Suspension bridges|Bridges in New York City"" to return all pages that belong to either (or both) of the categories, as here . Note that using search to find categories will not find articles which have been categorized using templates. This feature also doesn't return pages in subcategories. Listing all categories Special:Categories provides an alphabetic list of all categories, with the number of members of each; this number does not include the content of the subcategories, but it includes the subcategories themselves, i.e., each counting as one. The above list contains all categories that have members, regardless of whether they have corresponding category pages. To list all existing category pages (regardless of whether they have members), use Special:AllPages/Category: . Displaying category trees and page counts As described at mw:Help:Magic words , {{PAGESINCATEGORY: Example }} or {{PAGESINCAT: Example }} returns the number of pages in ""Category:Example"". Each subcategory counts as one page; pages in subcategories are not counted. The page Special:CategoryTree enables you to see the tree structure of a category (its subcategories, their subcategories and so on; the display of files and other member pages is optional). The CategoryTree extension can be used to display such a tree on any page. (This is sometimes done on the category page itself, if the category is split over multiple screens, to make all subcategories available on every screen.) The basic syntax is <categorytree> Category name </categorytree> to display just the subcategory tree, and <categorytree mode=pages> Category name </categorytree> to display member pages as well. They will be indicated by italics. Dapete's category-visualizer vCat will render charts of the tree structure. You may also use Template:Category tree or Template:Category tree all , instead. Warning: The following code {{PAGESINCATEGORY:{{PAGENAME}}}} will not work as expected when used in the wikitext or in a transcluded template in a category page whose title contains some ASCII punctuations. For legacy reasons, {{PAGENAME}} may return the page name with these characters being HTML-encoded using numeric character entities : this still works for generating derived wikilinks or displaying page names, or when HTML-encoded this page name is used in a conditional ""#switch"", but PAGESINCATEGORY does not recognize the category name given in parameter if some characters are HTML-encoded (this is the case notably when the category name contains ASCII apostrophes ' and a few other ASCII punctuations. (The same HTML-encoding is also applied to the values returned by {{FULLPAGENAME}} , {{SUBPAGENAME}} , or {{NAMESPACE}} ). In that case, as the category is not found by its HTML-encoded pagename, PAGESINCATEGORY will unexpectedly return 0 and not its effective number of member pages. A simple workaround is to transform these HTML-encoded characters back into standard UTF-8-encoded characters, by using the {{titleparts:}} parser function, like this: {{PAGESINCATEGORY:{{titleparts:{{PAGENAME}}}}}} Moving and redirecting category pages Categories can be moved in the same way as an ordinary page; but a certain amount of cleanup may be necessary. A redirect is left at the old category name, and this is not a normal #REDIRECT [[...]] but a {{ category redirect }} . Once all the pages have been moved out of the old category, it may be left as a category redirect or deleted. For categories entirely populated through templates (see above), modifying the templates enables all affected articles to be moved to another category, but with the refresh problem mentioned. Almost all category name changes are made pursuant to a consensus decision at Wikipedia:Categories for discussion . Do not create intercategory redirects other than with a {{ category redirect }} template. See Wikipedia:Categories for discussion § Redirecting categories for more on category redirects. Hiding categories When the magic word __HIDDENCAT__ is placed on a category page, that category becomes hidden , meaning that it will not be displayed on the pages belonging to that category. On Wikipedia, the magic word is not normally used explicitly, but is applied through the {{ hidden category }} template. The feature is mostly used to prevent project maintenance categories from showing up to ordinary readers on article pages. For users who are not logged in , hidden categories are displayed on category pages (whether as parent categories or subcategories). Hidden categories are displayed at the bottom of each page, after ""Hidden categories:"", for registered users: at preview during editing; if the user has selected ""Show hidden categories"" in their user preferences. Hidden categories are automatically added to Category:Hidden categories . For guidelines on the hiding of categories on Wikipedia, see WP:HIDDENCAT . Finding articles for a category The most effective way of finding entries of a category is using the "" What links here "" tool on the category's main article. An easy way to find relevant articles for a new category or missing entries in an existing one is by finding the most relevant list and checking its entries. Sometimes categories are about things that are intersections of other categories for which the PetScan tool can be used. More relevant articles may also be found linked in a category's main article and the articles already featured in the category − especially in their ""See also"" sections (if existent) and the automatically suggested ""RELATED ARTICLES"" below them. Furthermore, a category's superordinate categories often feature articles that should be subcategorized to the category. Other ways to find relevant articles include searching Wikipedia for the category's topic and searching the Web for the topic in quotes "" (with synonyms also in quotes and appended after an OR ) and appending the word wiki or Wikipedia or site:Wikipedia.org to them. Categorizing Main page: Wikipedia:Categorization Categorizing templates Templates are categorized the same way as articles, except that [[Category: Some-topic templates]] should be placed on the template's documentation page (or inside <noinclude>...</noinclude> tags, if there is no documentation page), this is necessary to avoid categorizing pages by template inclusion (see below). Categories and templates A template can be used to add pages to a category, usually by placing the category link inside <includeonly></includeonly> tags on the template (e.g. <includeonly>[[Category:category name]]</includeonly> ). When the template is transcluded into the page, the category link becomes active, and the page is added to the category page. This is useful for categories that have high turnover or many pages included, like cleanup categories. Changes to the template, however, may not be reflected immediately on the category page. When you edit an article to add a category tag directly, the list of category members is updated immediately when the page is saved. When a category link is contained in a template, however, this does not happen immediately: instead, whenever a template is edited, all the pages that transclude it are put into the job queue to be recached during periods of low server load. This means that, in busy periods, it may take hours or even days before individual pages are recached and they start to appear in the category list. Performing a null edit to a page will allow it to jump the queue and be immediately recached. To add the template itself to the category page as well, omit the ""includeonly"" tags. To add the template to a category without categorizing pages on which the template is transcluded, place the category declaration between <noinclude>...</noinclude> tags, or add it to the template documentation page between <includeonly></includeonly> (the latter allows recategorizing the template without editing it, which is helpful if it is protected, or so complicated that mere mortals hesitate to touch it). Parser functions can be used to make the transcluded categories, or the sort key used in them, dependent on other variables, notably PAGENAME. Passing a category name as a parameter <includeonly>[[Category:{{{cat|default}}}]]</includeonly> or <includeonly>{{{cat|[[Category:default]]}}}</includeonly> If the user provides a parameter 'cat=XXX' the page will be categorized at the page [[Category:XXX]] , otherwise it will be categorized at the page [[Category:default]] . Calling the template with ""cat="" (equal to nothing) disables putting the page in any category. Excluding non-article pages <includeonly>{{#if:{{NAMESPACE}} | | [[Category:XXX]]}}</includeonly> the variable NAMESPACE is null for mainspace articles. For any space other than mainspace, this ParserFunction will produce an empty string, but for regular articles this will include the article in Category:XXX. On Wikipedia it is not recommended that templates be used to populate ordinary content categories of articles. See Categorization using templates in the categorization guideline. Categorizing redirect pages Main page: Wikipedia:Categorizing redirects Redirect pages can be categorized and there are conventions on how to do it. The redirect link must be first on the page. On a category page, redirects are listed in italics. ""Related Changes"" with categories For a category, the "" Related Changes "" feature, when applied to the corresponding category page, lists recent changes to the pages which are currently listed as belonging to a category. Where those pages are subcategories or image pages, only changes to their editable parts are listed. Notice that ""Related Changes"" does not show edits to pages that have been removed from the category. Also, ""Related Changes"" does not list recent changes to pages linked from the editable part of the category page (as it would normally, with a non-category page). If a workaround would be required, the links in question could be placed in a template and transcluded onto the category page. As usual – unlike with watchlists – recent changes to corresponding talk pages are not shown under ""Related Changes"". Pages one is watching are bolded on the list. This can help to find which pages in a given category one has on one's watchlist. The DynamicPageList (third-party) extension provides a list of last edits to the pages in a category, or optionally, just the list of pages; the simpler DynamicPageList (Wikimedia) is installed on Meta, Wikinews, Wikibooks and Wikiversity; the extension mw:Extension:DPLforum is installed on Wikia. Watching category additions and removals Since 2016 , additions and removals from categories are available via the ""Category changes"" filter on recent changes pages, including watchlists and Special:RecentChangesLinked . For example, category changes to articles in Category:Cannabis stubs can be found here . You can monitor additions and removals from specific categories by adding the categories to your watchlist and making sure the ""Category changes"" filter is active. You can view changes to categories in your watchlist by clicking here . Additional scripts with similar functionality are User:CategoryWatchlistBot and User:Ais523/catwatch . See also MediaWiki: Help:Categories Template:Category TOC Wikipedia:FAQ/Categorization Wikipedia:WikiProject Categories Wikipedia:Quick cat index How to move a category Notes ^ The category itself is permanently created as soon as it has been saved on to any page. Unless you create a category page , it will display as a red link. Unless you add another category to the category page, it will not be placed in the category tree. Category pages are created like any other page. Most commonly, editors click on the redlink in an article and create the category page that way. v t e Wikipedia help pages Visit the Teahouse or the Help desk for an interactive Q & A forum.

It is not an integral in the Lebesgue sense; the word ""integral"" is used because the Berezin integral has properties analogous to the Lebesgue integral and because it extends the path integral in physics, where it is used as a sum over histories for fermions . Definition [ edit ] Let Λ n {\displaystyle \Lambda ^{n}} be the exterior algebra of polynomials in anticommuting elements θ 1 , … , θ n {\displaystyle \theta _{1},\dots ,\theta _{n}} over the field of complex numbers. (The ordering of the generators θ 1 , … , θ n {\displaystyle \theta _{1},\dots ,\theta _{n}} is fixed and defines the orientation of the exterior algebra.) One variable [ edit ] The Berezin integral over the sole Grassmann variable θ = θ 1 {\displaystyle \theta =\theta _{1}} is defined to be a linear functional ∫ [ a f ( θ ) + b g ( θ ) ] d θ = a ∫ f ( θ ) d θ + b ∫ g ( θ ) d θ , a , b ∈ C {\displaystyle \int [af(\theta )+bg(\theta )]\,d\theta =a\int f(\theta )\,d\theta +b\int g(\theta )\,d\theta ,\quad a,b\in \mathbb {C} } where we define ∫ θ d θ = 1 , ∫ d θ = 0 {\displaystyle \int \theta \,d\theta =1,\qquad \int \,d\theta =0} so that : ∫ ∂ ∂ θ f ( θ ) d θ = 0. {\displaystyle \int {\frac {\partial }{\partial \theta }}f(\theta )\,d\theta =0.} These properties define the integral uniquely and imply ∫ ( a θ + b ) d θ = a , a , b ∈ C . {\displaystyle \int (a\theta +b)\,d\theta =a,\quad a,b\in \mathbb {C} .} Take note that f ( θ ) = a θ + b {\displaystyle f(\theta )=a\theta +b} is the most general function of θ {\displaystyle \theta } because Grassmann variables square to zero, so f ( θ ) {\displaystyle f(\theta )} cannot have non-zero terms beyond linear order. Multiple variables [ edit ] The Berezin integral on Λ n {\displaystyle \Lambda ^{n}} is defined to be the unique linear functional ∫ Λ n ⋅ d θ {\displaystyle \int _{\Lambda ^{n}}\cdot {\textrm {d}}\theta } with the following properties: ∫ Λ n θ n ⋯ θ 1 d θ = 1 , {\displaystyle \int _{\Lambda ^{n}}\theta _{n}\cdots \theta _{1}\,\mathrm {d} \theta =1,} ∫ Λ n ∂ f ∂ θ i d θ = 0 , i = 1 , … , n {\displaystyle \int _{\Lambda ^{n}}{\frac {\partial f}{\partial \theta _{i}}}\,\mathrm {d} \theta =0,\ i=1,\dots ,n} for any f ∈ Λ n , {\displaystyle f\in \Lambda ^{n},} where ∂ / ∂ θ i {\displaystyle \partial /\partial \theta _{i}} means the left or the right partial derivative. These properties define the integral uniquely. Notice that different conventions exist in the literature: Some authors define instead [1] ∫ Λ n θ 1 ⋯ θ n d θ := 1. {\displaystyle \int _{\Lambda ^{n}}\theta _{1}\cdots \theta _{n}\,\mathrm {d} \theta :=1.} The formula ∫ Λ n f ( θ ) d θ = ∫ Λ 1 ( ⋯ ∫ Λ 1 ( ∫ Λ 1 f ( θ ) d θ 1 ) d θ 2 ⋯ ) d θ n {\displaystyle \int _{\Lambda ^{n}}f(\theta )\,\mathrm {d} \theta =\int _{\Lambda ^{1}}\left(\cdots \int _{\Lambda ^{1}}\left(\int _{\Lambda ^{1}}f(\theta )\,\mathrm {d} \theta _{1}\right)\,\mathrm {d} \theta _{2}\cdots \right)\mathrm {d} \theta _{n}} expresses the Fubini law. On the right-hand side, the interior integral of a monomial f = g ( θ ′ ) θ 1 {\displaystyle f=g(\theta ')\theta _{1}} is set to be g ( θ ′ ) , {\displaystyle g(\theta '),} where θ ′ = ( θ 2 , … , θ n ) {\displaystyle \theta '=\left(\theta _{2},\ldots ,\theta _{n}\right)} ; the integral of f = g ( θ ′ ) {\displaystyle f=g(\theta ')} vanishes. The integral with respect to θ 2 {\displaystyle \theta _{2}} is calculated in the similar way and so on. Change of Grassmann variables [ edit ] Let θ i = θ i ( ξ 1 , … , ξ n ) , i = 1 , … , n , {\displaystyle \theta _{i}=\theta _{i}\left(\xi _{1},\ldots ,\xi _{n}\right),\ i=1,\ldots ,n,} be odd polynomials in some antisymmetric variables ξ 1 , … , ξ n {\displaystyle \xi _{1},\ldots ,\xi _{n}} . The Jacobian is the matrix D = { ∂ θ i ∂ ξ j , i , j = 1 , … , n } , {\displaystyle D=\left\{{\frac {\partial \theta _{i}}{\partial \xi _{j}}},\ i,j=1,\ldots ,n\right\},} where ∂ / ∂ ξ j {\displaystyle \partial /\partial \xi _{j}} refers to the right derivative ( ∂ ( θ 1 θ 2 ) / ∂ θ 2 = θ 1 , ∂ ( θ 1 θ 2 ) / ∂ θ 1 = − θ 2 {\displaystyle \partial (\theta _{1}\theta _{2})/\partial \theta _{2}=\theta _{1},\;\partial (\theta _{1}\theta _{2})/\partial \theta _{1}=-\theta _{2}} ). The formula for the coordinate change reads ∫ f ( θ ) d θ = ∫ f ( θ ( ξ ) ) ( det D ) − 1 d ξ . {\displaystyle \int f(\theta )\,\mathrm {d} \theta =\int f(\theta (\xi ))(\det D)^{-1}\,\mathrm {d} \xi .} Integrating even and odd variables [ edit ] Definition [ edit ] Consider now the algebra Λ m ∣ n {\displaystyle \Lambda ^{m\mid n}} of functions of real commuting variables x = x 1 , … , x m {\displaystyle x=x_{1},\ldots ,x_{m}} and of anticommuting variables θ 1 , … , θ n {\displaystyle \theta _{1},\ldots ,\theta _{n}} (which is called the free superalgebra of dimension ( m | n ) {\displaystyle (m|n)} ). Intuitively, a function f = f ( x , θ ) ∈ Λ m ∣ n {\displaystyle f=f(x,\theta )\in \Lambda ^{m\mid n}} is a function of m even (bosonic, commuting) variables and of n odd (fermionic, anti-commuting) variables. More formally, an element f = f ( x , θ ) ∈ Λ m ∣ n {\displaystyle f=f(x,\theta )\in \Lambda ^{m\mid n}} is a function of the argument x {\displaystyle x} that varies in an open set X ⊂ R m {\displaystyle X\subset \mathbb {R} ^{m}} with values in the algebra Λ n . {\displaystyle \Lambda ^{n}.} Suppose that this function is continuous and vanishes in the complement of a compact set K ⊂ R m . {\displaystyle K\subset \mathbb {R} ^{m}.} The Berezin integral is the number ∫ Λ m ∣ n f ( x , θ ) d θ d x = ∫ R m d x ∫ Λ n f ( x , θ ) d θ . {\displaystyle \int _{\Lambda ^{m\mid n}}f(x,\theta )\,\mathrm {d} \theta \,\mathrm {d} x=\int _{\mathbb {R} ^{m}}\,\mathrm {d} x\int _{\Lambda ^{n}}f(x,\theta )\,\mathrm {d} \theta .} Change of even and odd variables [ edit ] Let a coordinate transformation be given by x i = x i ( y , ξ ) , i = 1 , … , m ; θ j = θ j ( y , ξ ) , j = 1 , … , n , {\displaystyle x_{i}=x_{i}(y,\xi ),\ i=1,\ldots ,m;\ \theta _{j}=\theta _{j}(y,\xi ),j=1,\ldots ,n,} where x i {\displaystyle x_{i}} are even and θ j {\displaystyle \theta _{j}} are odd polynomials of ξ {\displaystyle \xi } depending on even variables y . {\displaystyle y.} The Jacobian matrix of this transformation has the block form: J = ∂ ( x , θ ) ∂ ( y , ξ ) = ( A B C D ) , {\displaystyle \mathrm {J} ={\frac {\partial (x,\theta )}{\partial (y,\xi )}}={\begin{pmatrix}A&B\\C&D\end{pmatrix}},} where each even derivative ∂ / ∂ y j {\displaystyle \partial /\partial y_{j}} commutes with all elements of the algebra Λ m ∣ n {\displaystyle \Lambda ^{m\mid n}} ; the odd derivatives commute with even elements and anticommute with odd elements. The entries of the diagonal blocks A = ∂ x / ∂ y {\displaystyle A=\partial x/\partial y} and D = ∂ θ / ∂ ξ {\displaystyle D=\partial \theta /\partial \xi } are even and the entries of the off-diagonal blocks B = ∂ x / ∂ ξ , C = ∂ θ / ∂ y {\displaystyle B=\partial x/\partial \xi ,\ C=\partial \theta /\partial y} are odd functions, where ∂ / ∂ ξ j {\displaystyle \partial /\partial \xi _{j}} again mean right derivatives . We now need the Berezinian (or superdeterminant ) of the matrix J {\displaystyle \mathrm {J} } , which is the even function Ber ⁡ J = det ( A − B D − 1 C ) det D − 1 {\displaystyle \operatorname {Ber} \mathrm {J} =\det \left(A-BD^{-1}C\right)\det D^{-1}} defined when the function det D {\displaystyle \det D} is invertible in Λ m ∣ n . {\displaystyle \Lambda ^{m\mid n}.} Suppose that the real functions x i = x i ( y , 0 ) {\displaystyle x_{i}=x_{i}(y,0)} define a smooth invertible map F : Y → X {\displaystyle F:Y\to X} of open sets X , Y {\displaystyle X,Y} in R m {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{m}} and the linear part of the map ξ ↦ θ = θ ( y , ξ ) {\displaystyle \xi \mapsto \theta =\theta (y,\xi )} is invertible for each y ∈ Y . {\displaystyle y\in Y.} The general transformation law for the Berezin integral reads ∫ Λ m ∣ n f ( x , θ ) d θ d x = ∫ Λ m ∣ n f ( x ( y , ξ ) , θ ( y , ξ ) ) ε Ber ⁡ J d ξ d y = ∫ Λ m ∣ n f ( x ( y , ξ ) , θ ( y , ξ ) ) ε det ( A − B D − 1 C ) det D d ξ d y , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&\int _{\Lambda ^{m\mid n}}f(x,\theta )\,\mathrm {d} \theta \,\mathrm {d} x=\int _{\Lambda ^{m\mid n}}f(x(y,\xi ),\theta (y,\xi ))\varepsilon \operatorname {Ber} \mathrm {J} \,\mathrm {d} \xi \,\mathrm {d} y\\[6pt]={}&\int _{\Lambda ^{m\mid n}}f(x(y,\xi ),\theta (y,\xi ))\varepsilon {\frac {\det \left(A-BD^{-1}C\right)}{\det D}}\,\mathrm {d} \xi \,\mathrm {d} y,\end{aligned}}} where ε = s g n ( det ∂ x ( y , 0 ) / ∂ y {\displaystyle \varepsilon =\mathrm {sgn} (\det \partial x(y,0)/\partial y} ) is the sign of the orientation of the map F . {\displaystyle F.} The superposition f ( x ( y , ξ ) , θ ( y , ξ ) ) {\displaystyle f(x(y,\xi ),\theta (y,\xi ))} is defined in the obvious way, if the functions x i ( y , ξ ) {\displaystyle x_{i}(y,\xi )} do not depend on ξ . {\displaystyle \xi .} In the general case, we write x i ( y , ξ ) = x i ( y , 0 ) + δ i , {\displaystyle x_{i}(y,\xi )=x_{i}(y,0)+\delta _{i},} where δ i , i = 1 , … , m {\displaystyle \delta _{i},i=1,\ldots ,m} are even nilpotent elements of Λ m ∣ n {\displaystyle \Lambda ^{m\mid n}} and set f ( x ( y , ξ ) , θ ) = f ( x ( y , 0 ) , θ ) + ∑ i ∂ f ∂ x i ( x ( y , 0 ) , θ ) δ i + 1 2 ∑ i , j ∂ 2 f ∂ x i ∂ x j ( x ( y , 0 ) , θ ) δ i δ j + ⋯ , {\displaystyle f(x(y,\xi ),\theta )=f(x(y,0),\theta )+\sum _{i}{\frac {\partial f}{\partial x_{i}}}(x(y,0),\theta )\delta _{i}+{\frac {1}{2}}\sum _{i,j}{\frac {\partial ^{2}f}{\partial x_{i}\,\partial x_{j}}}(x(y,0),\theta )\delta _{i}\delta _{j}+\cdots ,} where the Taylor series is finite. Useful formulas [ edit ] The following formulas for Gaussian integrals are used often in the path integral formulation of quantum field theory : ∫ exp ⁡ [ − θ T A η ] d θ d η = det A {\displaystyle \int \exp \left[-\theta ^{T}A\eta \right]\,d\theta \,d\eta =\det A} with A {\displaystyle A} being a complex n × n {\displaystyle n\times n} matrix. ∫ exp ⁡ [ − 1 2 θ T M θ ] d θ = { P f M n even 0 n odd {\displaystyle \int \exp \left[-{\tfrac {1}{2}}\theta ^{T}M\theta \right]\,d\theta ={\begin{cases}\mathrm {Pf} \,M&n{\mbox{ even}}\\0&n{\mbox{ odd}}\end{cases}}} with M {\displaystyle M} being a complex skew-symmetric n × n {\displaystyle n\times n} matrix, and P f M {\displaystyle \mathrm {Pf} \,M} being the Pfaffian of M {\displaystyle M} , which fulfills ( P f M ) 2 = det M {\displaystyle (\mathrm {Pf} \,M)^{2}=\det M} . In the above formulas the notation d θ = d θ 1 ⋯ d θ n {\displaystyle d\theta =d\theta _{1}\cdots \,d\theta _{n}} is used. From these formulas, other useful formulas follow (See Appendix A in [2] ) : ∫ exp ⁡ [ θ T A η + θ T J + K T η ] d η 1 d θ 1 … d η n d θ n = det A exp ⁡ [ − K T A − 1 J ] {\displaystyle \int \exp \left[\theta ^{T}A\eta +\theta ^{T}J+K^{T}\eta \right]\,d\eta _{1}\,d\theta _{1}\dots d\eta _{n}d\theta _{n}=\det A\,\,\exp[-K^{T}A^{-1}J]} with A {\displaystyle A} being an invertible n × n {\displaystyle n\times n} matrix. Note that these integrals are all in the form of a partition function . History [ edit ] Berezin integral was probably first presented by David John Candlin in 1956. [3] Later it was independently discovered by Felix Berezin in 1966. [4] Unfortunately Candlin's article failed to attract notice, and has been buried in oblivion. Berezin's work came to be widely known, and has almost been cited universally, [footnote 1] becoming an indispensable tool to treat quantum field theory of fermions by functional integral. Other authors contributed to these developments, including the physicists Khalatnikov [9] (although his paper contains mistakes), Matthews and Salam, [10] and Martin. [11] See also [ edit ] Supermanifold Berezinian Footnote [ edit ] ^ For example many famous textbooks of quantum field theory cite Berezin. [5] [6] [7] One exception was Stanley Mandelstam who is said to have used to cite Candlin's work. [8] References [ edit ] ^ Mirror symmetry . Hori, Kentaro.

In such a formulation, along with ordinary space dimensions x , y , z , ..., there are also ""anticommuting"" dimensions whose coordinates are labeled in Grassmann numbers rather than real numbers. The ordinary space dimensions correspond to bosonic degrees of freedom, the anticommuting dimensions to fermionic degrees of freedom. The word ""superspace"" was first used by John Wheeler in an unrelated sense to describe the configuration space of general relativity ; for example, this usage may be seen in his 1973 textbook Gravitation . Informal discussion [ edit ] There are several similar, but not equivalent, definitions of superspace that have been used, and continue to be used in the mathematical and physics literature. One such usage is as a synonym for super Minkowski space . [1] In this case, one takes ordinary Minkowski space , and extends it with anti-commuting fermionic degrees of freedom, taken to be anti-commuting Weyl spinors from the Clifford algebra associated to the Lorentz group . Equivalently, the super Minkowski space can be understood as the quotient of the super Poincaré algebra modulo the algebra of the Lorentz group. A typical notation for the coordinates on such a space is ( x , θ , θ ¯ ) {\displaystyle (x,\theta ,{\bar {\theta }})} with the overline being the give-away that super Minkowski space is the intended space. Superspace is also commonly used as a synonym for the super vector space . This is taken to be an ordinary vector space , together with additional coordinates taken from the Grassmann algebra , i.e. coordinate directions that are Grassmann numbers . There are several conventions for constructing a super vector space in use; two of these are described by Rogers [2] and DeWitt. [3] A third usage of the term ""superspace"" is as a synonym for a supermanifold : a supersymmetric generalization of a manifold . Note that both super Minkowski spaces and super vector spaces can be taken as special cases of supermanifolds. A fourth, and completely unrelated meaning saw a brief usage in general relativity ; this is discussed in greater detail at the bottom. Examples [ edit ] Several examples are given below. The first few assume a definition of superspace as a super vector space . This is denoted as R m | n , the Z 2 - graded vector space with R m as the even subspace and R n as the odd subspace. The same definition applies to C m|n . The four-dimensional examples take superspace to be super Minkowski space . Although similar to a vector space, this has many important differences: First of all, it is an affine space , having no special point denoting the origin. Next, the fermionic coordinates are taken to be anti-commuting Weyl spinors from the Clifford algebra , rather than being Grassmann numbers . The difference here is that the Clifford algebra has a considerably richer and more subtle structure than the Grassmann numbers. So, the Grassmann numbers are elements of the exterior algebra , and the Clifford algebra has an isomorphism to the exterior algebra, but its relation to the orthogonal group and the spin group , used to construct the spin representations , give it a deep geometric significance. (For example, the spin groups form a normal part of the study of Riemannian geometry , [4] quite outside the ordinary bounds and concerns of physics.) Trivial examples [ edit ] The smallest superspace is a point which contains neither bosonic nor fermionic directions. Other trivial examples include the n -dimensional real plane R n , which is a vector space extending in n real, bosonic directions and no fermionic directions. The vector space R 0|n , which is the n -dimensional real Grassmann algebra . The space R 1|1 of one even and one odd direction is known as the space of dual numbers , introduced by William Clifford in 1873. The superspace of supersymmetric quantum mechanics [ edit ] Supersymmetric quantum mechanics with N supercharges is often formulated in the superspace R 1|2 N , which contains one real direction t identified with time and N complex Grassmann directions which are spanned by Θ i and Θ * i , where i runs from 1 to N . Consider the special case N = 1. The superspace R 1|2 is a 3-dimensional vector space. A given coordinate therefore may be written as a triple ( t , Θ, Θ * ). The coordinates form a Lie superalgebra , in which the gradation degree of t is even and that of Θ and Θ * is odd. This means that a bracket may be defined between any two elements of this vector space, and that this bracket reduces to the commutator on two even coordinates and on one even and one odd coordinate while it is an anticommutator on two odd coordinates. This superspace is an abelian Lie superalgebra, which means that all of the aforementioned brackets vanish [ t , t ] = [ t , θ ] = [ t , θ ∗ ] = { θ , θ } = { θ , θ ∗ } = { θ ∗ , θ ∗ } = 0 {\displaystyle \left[t,t\right]=\left[t,\theta \right]=\left[t,\theta ^{*}\right]=\left\{\theta ,\theta \right\}=\left\{\theta ,\theta ^{*}\right\}=\left\{\theta ^{*},\theta ^{*}\right\}=0} where [ a , b ] {\displaystyle [a,b]} is the commutator of a and b and { a , b } {\displaystyle \{a,b\}} is the anticommutator of a and b . One may define functions from this vector space to itself, which are called superfields . The above algebraic relations imply that, if we expand our superfield as a power series in Θ and Θ * , then we will only find terms at the zeroeth and first orders, because Θ 2 = Θ *2 = 0. Therefore, superfields may be written as arbitrary functions of t multiplied by the zeroeth and first order terms in the two Grassmann coordinates Φ ( t , Θ , Θ ∗ ) = ϕ ( t ) + Θ Ψ ( t ) − Θ ∗ Φ ∗ ( t ) + Θ Θ ∗ F ( t ) {\displaystyle \Phi \left(t,\Theta ,\Theta ^{*}\right)=\phi (t)+\Theta \Psi (t)-\Theta ^{*}\Phi ^{*}(t)+\Theta \Theta ^{*}F(t)} Superfields, which are representations of the supersymmetry of superspace, generalize the notion of tensors , which are representations of the rotation group of a bosonic space. One may then define derivatives in the Grassmann directions, which take the first order term in the expansion of a superfield to the zeroeth order term and annihilate the zeroeth order term. One can choose sign conventions such that the derivatives satisfy the anticommutation relations { ∂ ∂ θ , Θ } = { ∂ ∂ θ ∗ , Θ ∗ } = 1 {\displaystyle \left\{{\frac {\partial }{\partial \theta }}\,,\Theta \right\}=\left\{{\frac {\partial }{\partial \theta ^{*}}}\,,\Theta ^{*}\right\}=1} These derivatives may be assembled into supercharges Q = ∂ ∂ θ − i Θ ∗ ∂ ∂ t and Q † = ∂ ∂ θ ∗ + i Θ ∂ ∂ t {\displaystyle Q={\frac {\partial }{\partial \theta }}-i\Theta ^{*}{\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}\quad {\text{and}}\quad Q^{\dagger }={\frac {\partial }{\partial \theta ^{*}}}+i\Theta {\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}} whose anticommutators identify them as the fermionic generators of a supersymmetry algebra { Q , Q † } = 2 i ∂ ∂ t {\displaystyle \left\{Q,Q^{\dagger }\,\right\}=2i{\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}} where i times the time derivative is the Hamiltonian operator in quantum mechanics . Both Q and its adjoint anticommute with themselves. The supersymmetry variation with supersymmetry parameter ε of a superfield Φ is defined to be δ ϵ Φ = ( ϵ ∗ Q + ϵ Q † ) Φ . {\displaystyle \delta _{\epsilon }\Phi =(\epsilon ^{*}Q+\epsilon Q^{\dagger })\Phi .} We can evaluate this variation using the action of Q on the superfields [ Q , Φ ] = ( ∂ ∂ θ − i θ ∗ ∂ ∂ t ) Φ = ψ + θ ∗ ( F − i ϕ ˙ ) + i θ θ ∗ ψ ˙ . {\displaystyle \left[Q,\Phi \right]=\left({\frac {\partial }{\partial \theta }}\,-i\theta ^{*}{\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}\right)\Phi =\psi +\theta ^{*}\left(F-i{\dot {\phi }}\right)+i\theta \theta ^{*}{\dot {\psi }}.} Similarly one may define covariant derivatives on superspace D = ∂ ∂ θ − i θ ∗ ∂ ∂ t and D † = ∂ ∂ θ ∗ − i θ ∂ ∂ t {\displaystyle D={\frac {\partial }{\partial \theta }}-i\theta ^{*}{\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}\quad {\text{and}}\quad D^{\dagger }={\frac {\partial }{\partial \theta ^{*}}}-i\theta {\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}} which anticommute with the supercharges and satisfy a wrong sign supersymmetry algebra { D , D † } = − 2 i ∂ ∂ t {\displaystyle \left\{D,D^{\dagger }\right\}=-2i{\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}} . The fact that the covariant derivatives anticommute with the supercharges means the supersymmetry transformation of a covariant derivative of a superfield is equal to the covariant derivative of the same supersymmetry transformation of the same superfield. Thus, generalizing the covariant derivative in bosonic geometry which constructs tensors from tensors, the superspace covariant derivative constructs superfields from superfields. Supersymmetric extensions of Minkowski space [ edit ] See also: Super Minkowski space N = 1 super Minkowski space [ edit ] Perhaps the most studied concrete superspace in physics is d = 4 , N = 1 {\displaystyle d=4,{\mathcal {N}}=1} super Minkowski space R 4 | 4 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{4|4}} or sometimes written R 1 , 3 | 4 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{1,3|4}} , which is the direct sum of four real bosonic dimensions and four real Grassmann dimensions (also known as fermionic dimensions or spin dimensions ). [5] In supersymmetric quantum field theories one is interested in superspaces which furnish representations of a Lie superalgebra called a supersymmetry algebra . The bosonic part of the supersymmetry algebra is the Poincaré algebra , while the fermionic part is constructed using spinors with Grassmann number valued components. For this reason, in physical applications one considers an action of the supersymmetry algebra on the four fermionic directions of R 4 | 4 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{4|4}} such that they transform as a spinor under the Poincaré subalgebra. In four dimensions there are three distinct irreducible 4-component spinors. There is the Majorana spinor , the left-handed Weyl spinor and the right-handed Weyl spinor. The CPT theorem implies that in a unitary , Poincaré invariant theory, which is a theory in which the S-matrix is a unitary matrix and the same Poincaré generators act on the asymptotic in-states as on the asymptotic out-states, the supersymmetry algebra must contain an equal number of left-handed and right-handed Weyl spinors. However, since each Weyl spinor has four components, this means that if one includes any Weyl spinors one must have 8 fermionic directions. Such a theory is said to have extended supersymmetry , and such models have received a lot of attention. For example, supersymmetric gauge theories with eight supercharges and fundamental matter have been solved by Nathan Seiberg and Edward Witten , see Seiberg–Witten gauge theory . However, in this subsection we are considering the superspace with four fermionic components and so no Weyl spinors are consistent with the CPT theorem. Note : There are many sign conventions in use and this is only one of them. Therefore the four fermionic directions transform as a Majorana spinor θ α {\displaystyle \theta _{\alpha }} . We can also form a conjugate spinor θ ¯ = d e f i θ † γ 0 = − θ ⊥ C {\displaystyle {\bar {\theta }}\ {\stackrel {\mathrm {def} }{=}}\ i\theta ^{\dagger }\gamma ^{0}=-\theta ^{\perp }C} where C {\displaystyle C} is the charge conjugation matrix, which is defined by the property that when it conjugates a gamma matrix , the gamma matrix is negated and transposed. The first equality is the definition of θ ¯ {\displaystyle {\bar {\theta }}} while the second is a consequence of the Majorana spinor condition θ ∗ = i γ 0 C θ {\displaystyle \theta ^{*}=i\gamma _{0}C\theta } . The conjugate spinor plays a role similar to that of θ ∗ {\displaystyle \theta ^{*}} in the superspace R 1 | 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{1|2}} , except that the Majorana condition, as manifested in the above equation, imposes that θ {\displaystyle \theta } and θ ∗ {\displaystyle \theta ^{*}} are not independent. In particular we may construct the supercharges Q = − ∂ ∂ θ ¯ + γ μ θ ∂ μ {\displaystyle Q=-{\frac {\partial }{\partial {\bar {\theta }}}}+\gamma ^{\mu }\theta \partial _{\mu }} which satisfy the supersymmetry algebra { Q , Q } = { Q ¯ , Q } C = 2 γ μ ∂ μ C = − 2 i γ μ P μ C {\displaystyle \left\{Q,Q\right\}=\left\{{\overline {Q}},Q\right\}C=2\gamma ^{\mu }\partial _{\mu }C=-2i\gamma ^{\mu }P_{\mu }C} where P = i ∂ μ {\displaystyle P=i\partial _{\mu }} is the 4- momentum operator. Again the covariant derivative is defined like the supercharge but with the second term negated and it anticommutes with the supercharges. Thus the covariant derivative of a supermultiplet is another supermultiplet. Extended supersymmetry [ edit ] See also: Extended supersymmetry It is possible to have N {\displaystyle {\mathcal {N}}} sets of supercharges Q I {\displaystyle Q^{I}} with I = 1 , ⋯ , N {\displaystyle I=1,\cdots ,{\mathcal {N}}} , although this is not possible for all values of N {\displaystyle {\mathcal {N}}} . These supercharges generate translations in a total of 4 N {\displaystyle 4{\mathcal {N}}} spin dimensions, hence forming the superspace R 4 | 4 N {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{4|4{\mathcal {N}}}} . In general relativity [ edit ] The word ""superspace"" is also used in a completely different and unrelated sense, in the book Gravitation by Misner, Thorne and Wheeler. There, it refers to the configuration space of general relativity , and, in particular, the view of gravitation as geometrodynamics , an interpretation of general relativity as a form of dynamical geometry. In modern terms, this particular idea of ""superspace"" is captured in one of several different formalisms used in solving the Einstein equations in a variety of settings, both theoretical and practical, such as in numerical simulations. This includes primarily the ADM formalism , as well as ideas surrounding the Hamilton–Jacobi–Einstein equation and the Wheeler–DeWitt equation .

( July 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Hermann Grassmann was the third of 12 children of Justus Günter Grassmann, an ordained minister who taught mathematics and physics at the Stettin Gymnasium , where Hermann was educated. Grassmann was an undistinguished student until he obtained a high mark on the examinations for admission to Prussian universities. Beginning in 1827, he studied theology at the University of Berlin , also taking classes in classical languages , philosophy, and literature. He does not appear to have taken courses in mathematics or physics . Although lacking university training in mathematics, it was the field that most interested him when he returned to Stettin in 1830 after completing his studies in Berlin. After a year of preparation, he sat the examinations needed to teach mathematics in a gymnasium, but achieved a result good enough to allow him to teach only at the lower levels. Around this time, he made his first significant mathematical discoveries, ones that led him to the important ideas he set out in his 1844 paper Die lineale Ausdehnungslehre, ein neuer Zweig der Mathematik , here referred to as A1 , later revised in 1862 as Die Ausdehnungslehre: Vollständig und in strenger Form bearbeitet , here referred to as A2 . In 1834 Grassmann began teaching mathematics at the Gewerbeschule in Berlin. A year later, he returned to Stettin to teach mathematics, physics, German, Latin, and religious studies at a new school, the Otto Schule. Over the next four years, Grassmann passed examinations enabling him to teach mathematics, physics , chemistry , and mineralogy at all secondary school levels. In 1847, he was made an ""Oberlehrer"" or head teacher. In 1852, he was appointed to his late father's position at the Stettin Gymnasium, thereby acquiring the title of Professor. In 1847, he asked the Prussian Ministry of Education to be considered for a university position, whereupon that Ministry asked Ernst Kummer for his opinion of Grassmann. Kummer wrote back saying that Grassmann's 1846 prize essay (see below) contained ""commendably good material expressed in a deficient form."" Kummer's report ended any chance that Grassmann might obtain a university post. This episode proved the norm; time and again, leading figures of Grassmann's day failed to recognize the value of his mathematics. Starting during the political turmoil in Germany, 1848–49, Hermann and his brother Robert published a Stettin newspaper, Deutsche Wochenschrift für Staat, Kirche und Volksleben , calling for German unification under a constitutional monarchy . (This eventuated in 1871.) After writing a series of articles on constitutional law , Hermann parted company with the newspaper, finding himself increasingly at odds with its political direction. Grassmann had eleven children, seven of whom reached adulthood. A son, Hermann Ernst Grassmann, became a professor of mathematics at the University of Giessen . Mathematician [ edit ] One of the many examinations for which Grassmann sat required that he submit an essay on the theory of the tides. In 1840, he did so, taking the basic theory from Laplace 's Traité de mécanique céleste and from Lagrange 's Mécanique analytique , but expositing this theory making use of the vector methods he had been mulling over since 1832. This essay, first published in the Collected Works of 1894–1911, contains the first known appearance of what is now called linear algebra and the notion of a vector space . He went on to develop those methods in his Die lineale Ausdehnungslehre, ein neuer Zweig der Mathematik ( A1 ) and its later revision Die Ausdehnungslehre: Vollständig und in strenger Form bearbeitet ( A2 ). In 1844, Grassmann published his masterpiece ( A1 ) commonly referred to as the Ausdehnungslehre , which translates as ""theory of extension"" or ""theory of extensive magnitudes"". Since A1 proposed a new foundation for all of mathematics, the work began with quite general definitions of a philosophical nature. Grassmann then showed that once geometry is put into the algebraic form he advocated, the number three has no privileged role as the number of spatial dimensions ; the number of possible dimensions is in fact unbounded. Fearnley-Sander describes Grassmann's foundation of linear algebra as follows: [1] The definition of a linear space ( vector space ) [...] became widely known around 1920, when Hermann Weyl and others published formal definitions. In fact, such a definition had been given thirty years previously by Peano , who was thoroughly acquainted with Grassmann's mathematical work. Grassmann did not put down a formal definition – the language was not available – but there is no doubt that he had the concept. Beginning with a collection of 'units' e 1 , e 2 , e 3 , ..., he effectively defines the free linear space that they generate; that is to say, he considers formal linear combinations a 1 e 1 + a 2 e 2 + a 3 e 3 + ... where the a j are real numbers, defines addition and multiplication by real numbers [in what is now the usual way] and formally proves the linear space properties for these operations. ... He then develops the theory of linear independence in a way that is astonishingly similar to the presentation one finds in modern linear algebra texts. He defines the notions of subspace , linear independence , span , dimension , join and meet of subspaces, and projections of elements onto subspaces. [...] few have come closer than Hermann Grassmann to creating, single-handedly, a new subject. Following an idea of Grassmann's father, A1 also defined the exterior product , also called ""combinatorial product"" (in German: kombinatorisches Produkt or äußeres Produkt “outer product”), the key operation of an algebra now called exterior algebra . (One should keep in mind that in Grassmann's day, the only axiomatic theory was Euclidean geometry , and the general notion of an abstract algebra had yet to be defined.) In 1878, William Kingdon Clifford joined this exterior algebra to William Rowan Hamilton 's quaternions by replacing Grassmann's rule e p e p = 0 by the rule e p e p = 1. (For quaternions , we have the rule i 2 = j 2 = k 2 = −1.) For more details, see Exterior algebra . A1 was a revolutionary text, too far ahead of its time to be appreciated. When Grassmann submitted it to apply for a professorship in 1847, the ministry asked Ernst Kummer for a report. Kummer assured that there were good ideas in it, but found the exposition deficient and advised against giving Grassmann a university position. Over the next 10-odd years, Grassmann wrote a variety of work applying his theory of extension, including his 1845 Neue Theorie der Elektrodynamik and several papers on algebraic curves and surfaces , in the hope that these applications would lead others to take his theory seriously. In 1846, Möbius invited Grassmann to enter a competition to solve a problem first proposed by Leibniz : to devise a geometric calculus devoid of coordinates and metric properties (what Leibniz termed analysis situs ). Grassmann's Geometrische Analyse geknüpft an die von Leibniz erfundene geometrische Charakteristik , was the winning entry (also the only entry). Möbius, as one of the judges, criticized the way Grassmann introduced abstract notions without giving the reader any intuition as to why those notions were of value. In 1853, Grassmann published a theory of how colors mix; his theory's four color laws are still taught, as Grassmann's laws . Grassmann's work on this subject was inconsistent with that of Helmholtz . [2] Grassmann also wrote on crystallography , electromagnetism , and mechanics . In 1861, Grassmann laid the groundwork for Peano's axiomatization of arithmetic in his Lehrbuch der Arithmetik . [3] In 1862, Grassmann published a thoroughly rewritten second edition of A1 , hoping to earn belated recognition for his theory of extension, and containing the definitive exposition of his linear algebra . The result, Die Ausdehnungslehre: Vollständig und in strenger Form bearbeitet ( A2 ), fared no better than A1 , even though A2 's manner of exposition anticipates the textbooks of the 20th century. Response [ edit ] In the 1840s, mathematicians were generally unprepared to understand Grassmann's ideas. [4] In the 1860s and 1870s various mathematicians came to ideas similar to that of Grassmann's, but Grassmann himself was not interested in mathematics anymore. [4] : 46 Adhémar Jean Claude Barré de Saint-Venant developed a vector calculus similar to that of Grassmann, which he published in 1845. He then entered into a dispute with Grassmann about which of the two had thought of the ideas first. Grassmann had published his results in 1844, but Saint-Venant claimed that he had first developed these ideas in 1832. One of the first mathematicians to appreciate Grassmann's ideas during his lifetime was Hermann Hankel , whose 1867 Theorie der complexen Zahlensysteme . [5] […], he developed […] some of Hermann Grassmann's algebras and W.R. Hamilton's quaternions . Hankel was the first to recognise the significance of Grassmann's long-neglected writings and was strongly influenced by them. In 1872 Victor Schlegel published the first part of his System der Raumlehre , which used Grassmann's approach to derive ancient and modern results in plane geometry . Felix Klein wrote a negative review of Schlegel's book citing its incompleteness and lack of perspective on Grassmann. Schlegel followed in 1875 with a second part of his System according to Grassmann, this time developing higher-dimensional geometry. Meanwhile, Klein was advancing his Erlangen program , which also expanded the scope of geometry. [6] Comprehension of Grassmann awaited the concept of vector spaces , which then could express the multilinear algebra of his extension theory. To establish the priority of Grassmann over Hamilton, Josiah Willard Gibbs urged Grassmann's heirs to have the 1840 essay on tides published. [7] A. N. Whitehead 's first monograph, the Universal Algebra (1898), included the first systematic exposition in English of the theory of extension and the exterior algebra . With the rise of differential geometry the exterior algebra was applied to differential forms . In 1995 Lloyd C. Kannenberg published an English translation of The Ausdehnungslehre and Other works. For an introduction to the role of Grassmann's work in contemporary mathematical physics see The Road to Reality by Roger Penrose . [8] Linguist [ edit ] Grassmann's mathematical ideas began to spread only towards the end of his life. Thirty years after the publication of A1 the publisher wrote to Grassmann: “Your book Die Ausdehnungslehre has been out of print for some time. Since your work hardly sold at all, roughly 600 copies were used in 1864 as waste paper and the remaining few odd copies have now been sold out, with the exception of the one copy in our library.” [4] : 45 Disappointed by the reception of his work in mathematical circles, Grassmann lost his contacts with mathematicians as well as his interest in geometry. In the last years of his life he turned to historical linguistics and the study of Sanskrit . He wrote books on German grammar , collected folk songs, and learned Sanskrit. He wrote a 2,000-page dictionary and a translation of the Rigveda (more than 1,000 pages). In modern studies of the Rigveda , Grassmann's work is often cited. In 1955 a third edition of his dictionary was issued. [4] : 46 Grassmann also noticed and presented a phonological rule that exists in both Sanskrit and Greek . In his honor, this phonological rule is known as Grassmann's law . His discovery was revolutionary for historical linguistics at the time, as it challenged the widespread notion of Sanskrit as an older predecessor to other Indo-European languages. [9] This was a widespread assumption due to Sanskrit's more agglutinative structure, which languages like Latin and Greek were thought to have passed through to reach their more ""modern"" synthetic structure. However, Grassman's work proved that, in at least one phonological pattern, German was indeed ""older"" (i.e., less synthetic) than Sanskrit. This meant that genealogical and typological classifications of languages were at last correctly separated in linguistics, allowing significant progress for later linguists. [10] These philological accomplishments were honored during his lifetime.

For the Airy stress function employed in solid mechanics, see Stress functions . For the Airy disk function that describes the optics diffraction pattern through a circular aperture, see Airy disk . For generic Airy distribution arising from optical resonance between two mirrors, see Fabry–Pérot interferometer . For the Airy equation as an example of a linear dispersive partial differential equation, see Dispersive partial differential equation . In the physical sciences, the Airy function (or Airy function of the first kind ) Ai( x ) is a special function named after the British astronomer George Biddell Airy (1801–1892). The function Ai( x ) and the related function Bi( x ) , are linearly independent solutions to the [[differential equation d 2 y d x 2 − x y = 0 , {\displaystyle {\frac {d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}}-xy=0,} known as the Airy equation or the Stokes equation . Because the solution of the linear differential equation d 2 y d x 2 − k y = 0 {\displaystyle {\frac {d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}}-ky=0} is oscillatory for k <0 and exponential for k >0 , the Airy functions are oscillatory for x <0 and exponential for x >0 . In fact, the Airy equation is the simplest second-order linear differential equation with a turning point (a point where the character of the solutions changes from oscillatory to exponential). Plot of the Airy function Ai( z ) in the complex plane from -2 - 2 i to 2 + 2 i with colors created with Mathematica 13.1 function ComplexPlot3D Plot of the derivative of the Airy function Ai'( z ) in the complex plane from -2 - 2 i to 2 + 2 i with colors created with Mathematica 13.1 function ComplexPlot3D Definitions [ edit ] Plot of Ai( x ) in red and Bi( x ) in blue For real values of x , the Airy function of the first kind can be defined by the improper Riemann integral : Ai ⁡ ( x ) = 1 π ∫ 0 ∞ cos ⁡ ( t 3 3 + x t ) d t ≡ 1 π lim b → ∞ ∫ 0 b cos ⁡ ( t 3 3 + x t ) d t , {\displaystyle \operatorname {Ai} (x)={\dfrac {1}{\pi }}\int _{0}^{\infty }\cos \left({\dfrac {t^{3}}{3}}+xt\right)\,dt\equiv {\dfrac {1}{\pi }}\lim _{b\to \infty }\int _{0}^{b}\cos \left({\dfrac {t^{3}}{3}}+xt\right)\,dt,} which converges by Dirichlet's test . For any real number x there is a positive real number M such that function t 3 3 + x t {\textstyle {\tfrac {t^{3}}{3}}+xt} is increasing, unbounded and convex with continuous and unbounded derivative on interval [ M , ∞ ) . {\displaystyle [M,\infty ).} The convergence of the integral on this interval can be proven by Dirichlet's test after substitution u = t 3 3 + x t . {\textstyle u={\tfrac {t^{3}}{3}}+xt.} y = Ai( x ) satisfies the Airy equation y ″ − x y = 0. {\displaystyle y''-xy=0.} This equation has two linearly independent solutions. Up to scalar multiplication, Ai( x ) is the solution subject to the condition y → 0 as x → ∞ . The standard choice for the other solution is the Airy function of the second kind, denoted Bi( x ). It is defined as the solution with the same amplitude of oscillation as Ai( x ) as x → −∞ which differs in phase by π /2 : Plot of the Airy function Bi( z ) in the complex plane from -2 - 2 i to 2 + 2 i with colors created with Mathematica 13.1 function ComplexPlot3D Bi ⁡ ( x ) = 1 π ∫ 0 ∞ [ exp ⁡ ( − t 3 3 + x t ) + sin ⁡ ( t 3 3 + x t ) ] d t . {\displaystyle \operatorname {Bi} (x)={\frac {1}{\pi }}\int _{0}^{\infty }\left[\exp \left(-{\tfrac {t^{3}}{3}}+xt\right)+\sin \left({\tfrac {t^{3}}{3}}+xt\right)\,\right]dt.} Plot of the derivative of the Airy function Bi'( z ) in the complex plane from -2 - 2 i to 2 + 2 i with colors created with Mathematica 13.1 function ComplexPlot3D Properties [ edit ] The values of Ai( x ) and Bi( x ) and their derivatives at x = 0 are given by Ai ⁡ ( 0 ) = 1 3 2 / 3 Γ ( 2 3 ) , Ai ′ ⁡ ( 0 ) = − 1 3 1 / 3 Γ ( 1 3 ) , Bi ⁡ ( 0 ) = 1 3 1 / 6 Γ ( 2 3 ) , Bi ′ ⁡ ( 0 ) = 3 1 / 6 Γ ( 1 3 ) . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\operatorname {Ai} (0)&{}={\frac {1}{3^{2/3}\,\Gamma \!\left({\frac {2}{3}}\right)}},&\quad \operatorname {Ai} '(0)&{}=-{\frac {1}{3^{1/3}\,\Gamma \!\left({\frac {1}{3}}\right)}},\\\operatorname {Bi} (0)&{}={\frac {1}{3^{1/6}\,\Gamma \!\left({\frac {2}{3}}\right)}},&\quad \operatorname {Bi} '(0)&{}={\frac {3^{1/6}}{\Gamma \!\left({\frac {1}{3}}\right)}}.\end{aligned}}} Here, Γ denotes the Gamma function . It follows that the Wronskian of Ai( x ) and Bi( x ) is 1/ π . When x is positive, Ai( x ) is positive, convex , and decreasing exponentially to zero, while Bi( x ) is positive, convex, and increasing exponentially. When x is negative, Ai( x ) and Bi( x ) oscillate around zero with ever-increasing frequency and ever-decreasing amplitude. This is supported by the asymptotic formulae below for the Airy functions. The Airy functions are orthogonal [1] in the sense that ∫ − ∞ ∞ Ai ⁡ ( t + x ) Ai ⁡ ( t + y ) d t = δ ( x − y ) {\displaystyle \int _{-\infty }^{\infty }\operatorname {Ai} (t+x)\operatorname {Ai} (t+y)dt=\delta (x-y)} again using an improper Riemann integral. Real zeros of Ai( x ) and its derivative Ai'( x ) Neither Ai( x ) nor its derivative Ai'( x ) have positive real zeros. The ""first"" real zeros (i.e. nearest to x=0) are: [2] ""first"" zeros of Ai( x ) are at x ≈ −2.33811, −4.08795, −5.52056, −6.78671, ... ""first"" zeros of its derivative Ai'( x ) are at x ≈ −1.01879, −3.24820, −4.82010, −6.16331, ... Asymptotic formulae [ edit ] Ai(blue) and sinusoidal/exponential asymptotic form of Ai(magenta) Bi(blue) and sinusoidal/exponential asymptotic form of Bi(magenta) As explained below, the Airy functions can be extended to the complex plane, giving entire functions . The asymptotic behaviour of the Airy functions as | z | goes to infinity at a constant value of arg ( z ) depends on arg( z ) : this is called the Stokes phenomenon . For | arg( z ) | < π we have the following asymptotic formula for Ai( z ) : [3] Ai ⁡ ( z ) ∼ 1 2 π z 1 / 4 exp ⁡ ( − 2 3 z 3 / 2 ) [ ∑ n = 0 ∞ ( − 1 ) n Γ ( n + 5 6 ) Γ ( n + 1 6 ) ( 3 4 ) n 2 π n ! z 3 n / 2 ] . {\displaystyle \operatorname {Ai} (z)\sim {\dfrac {1}{2{\sqrt {\pi }}\,z^{1/4}}}\exp \left(-{\frac {2}{3}}z^{3/2}\right)\left[\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\dfrac {(-1)^{n}\,\Gamma \!\left(n+{\frac {5}{6}}\right)\,\Gamma \!\left(n+{\frac {1}{6}}\right)\left({\frac {3}{4}}\right)^{n}}{2\pi \,n!\,z^{3n/2}}}\right].} or Ai ⁡ ( z ) ∼ e − ζ 4 π 3 / 2 z 1 / 4 [ ∑ n = 0 ∞ Γ ( n + 5 6 ) Γ ( n + 1 6 ) n !

Asymptotic expansions for these limits are also available. These are listed in (Abramowitz and Stegun, 1983) and (Olver, 1974). One is also able to obtain asymptotic expressions for the derivatives Ai'(z) and Bi'(z) . Similarly to before, when | arg( z ) | < π : [5] Ai ′ ⁡ ( z ) ∼ − z 1 / 4 2 π exp ⁡ ( − 2 3 z 3 / 2 ) [ ∑ n = 0 ∞ 1 + 6 n 1 − 6 n ( − 1 ) n Γ ( n + 5 6 ) Γ ( n + 1 6 ) ( 3 4 ) n 2 π n ! z 3 n / 2 ] . {\displaystyle \operatorname {Ai} '(z)\sim -{\dfrac {z^{1/4}}{2{\sqrt {\pi }}\,}}\exp \left(-{\frac {2}{3}}z^{3/2}\right)\left[\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {1+6n}{1-6n}}{\dfrac {(-1)^{n}\,\Gamma \!\left(n+{\frac {5}{6}}\right)\,\Gamma \!\left(n+{\frac {1}{6}}\right)\left({\frac {3}{4}}\right)^{n}}{2\pi \,n!\,z^{3n/2}}}\right].} When | arg( z ) | < π /3 we have: [5] Bi ′ ⁡ ( z ) ∼ z 1 / 4 π exp ⁡ ( 2 3 z 3 / 2 ) [ ∑ n = 0 ∞ 1 + 6 n 1 − 6 n Γ ( n + 5 6 ) Γ ( n + 1 6 ) ( 3 4 ) n 2 π n ! z 3 n / 2 ] . {\displaystyle \operatorname {Bi} '(z)\sim {\frac {z^{1/4}}{{\sqrt {\pi }}\,}}\exp \left({\frac {2}{3}}z^{3/2}\right)\left[\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {1+6n}{1-6n}}{\dfrac {\Gamma \!\left(n+{\frac {5}{6}}\right)\,\Gamma \!\left(n+{\frac {1}{6}}\right)\left({\frac {3}{4}}\right)^{n}}{2\pi \,n!\,z^{3n/2}}}\right].} Similarly, an expression for Ai'(− z ) and Bi'(− z ) when | arg( z ) | < 2 π /3 but not zero, are [5] Ai ′ ⁡ ( − z ) ∼ − z 1 / 4 π cos ⁡ ( 2 3 z 3 / 2 + π 4 ) [ ∑ n = 0 ∞ 1 + 12 n 1 − 12 n ( − 1 ) n Γ ( 2 n + 5 6 ) Γ ( 2 n + 1 6 ) ( 3 4 ) 2 n 2 π ( 2 n ) ! z 3 n ] − z 1 / 4 π sin ⁡ ( 2 3 z 3 / 2 + π 4 ) [ ∑ n = 0 ∞ 7 + 12 n − 5 − 12 n ( − 1 ) n Γ ( 2 n + 11 6 ) Γ ( 2 n + 7 6 ) ( 3 4 ) 2 n + 1 2 π ( 2 n + 1 ) ! z 3 n + 3 / 2 ] Bi ′ ⁡ ( − z ) ∼ z 1 / 4 π sin ⁡ ( 2 3 z 3 / 2 + π 4 ) [ ∑ n = 0 ∞ 1 + 12 n 1 − 12 n ( − 1 ) n Γ ( 2 n + 5 6 ) Γ ( 2 n + 1 6 ) ( 3 4 ) 2 n 2 π ( 2 n ) ! z 3 n ] − z 1 / 4 π cos ⁡ ( 2 3 z 3 / 2 + π 4 ) [ ∑ n = 0 ∞ 7 + 12 n − 5 − 12 n ( − 1 ) n Γ ( 2 n + 11 6 ) Γ ( 2 n + 7 6 ) ( 3 4 ) 2 n + 1 2 π ( 2 n + 1 ) ! z 3 n + 3 / 2 ] {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\operatorname {Ai} '(-z)\sim &{}-{\frac {z^{1/4}}{{\sqrt {\pi }}\,}}\cos \left({\frac {2}{3}}z^{3/2}+{\frac {\pi }{4}}\right)\left[\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {1+12n}{1-12n}}{\dfrac {(-1)^{n}\,\Gamma \!\left(2n+{\frac {5}{6}}\right)\,\Gamma \!\left(2n+{\frac {1}{6}}\right)\left({\frac {3}{4}}\right)^{2n}}{2\pi \,(2n)!\,z^{3n}}}\right]\\[6pt]&{}-{\frac {z^{1/4}}{{\sqrt {\pi }}\,}}\sin \left({\frac {2}{3}}z^{3/2}+{\frac {\pi }{4}}\right)\left[\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {7+12n}{-5-12n}}{\dfrac {(-1)^{n}\,\Gamma \!\left(2n+{\frac {11}{6}}\right)\,\Gamma \!\left(2n+{\frac {7}{6}}\right)\left({\frac {3}{4}}\right)^{2n+1}}{2\pi \,(2n+1)!\,z^{3n\,+\,3/2}}}\right]\\[6pt]\operatorname {Bi} '(-z)\sim &{}\ {\frac {z^{1/4}}{{\sqrt {\pi }}\,}}\sin \left({\frac {2}{3}}z^{3/2}+{\frac {\pi }{4}}\right)\left[\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {1+12n}{1-12n}}{\dfrac {(-1)^{n}\,\Gamma \!\left(2n+{\frac {5}{6}}\right)\,\Gamma \!\left(2n+{\frac {1}{6}}\right)\left({\frac {3}{4}}\right)^{2n}}{2\pi \,(2n)!\,z^{3n}}}\right]\\[6pt]&{}-{\frac {z^{1/4}}{{\sqrt {\pi }}\,}}\cos \left({\frac {2}{3}}z^{3/2}+{\frac {\pi }{4}}\right)\left[\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {7+12n}{-5-12n}}{\dfrac {(-1)^{n}\,\Gamma \!\left(2n+{\frac {11}{6}}\right)\,\Gamma \!\left(2n+{\frac {7}{6}}\right)\left({\frac {3}{4}}\right)^{2n+1}}{2\pi \,(2n+1)!\,z^{3n\,+\,3/2}}}\right]\\\end{aligned}}} Complex arguments [ edit ] We can extend the definition of the Airy function to the complex plane by Ai ⁡ ( z ) = 1 2 π i ∫ C exp ⁡ ( t 3 3 − z t ) d t , {\displaystyle \operatorname {Ai} (z)={\frac {1}{2\pi i}}\int _{C}\exp \left({\tfrac {t^{3}}{3}}-zt\right)\,dt,} where the integral is over a path C starting at the point at infinity with argument − π /3 and ending at the point at infinity with argument π/3. Alternatively, we can use the differential equation y ′′ − xy = 0 to extend Ai( x ) and Bi( x ) to entire functions on the complex plane. The asymptotic formula for Ai( x ) is still valid in the complex plane if the principal value of x 2/3 is taken and x is bounded away from the negative real axis. The formula for Bi( x ) is valid provided x is in the sector x ∈ C : | arg ⁡ ( x ) | < π 3 − δ {\displaystyle x\in \mathbb {C} :\left|\arg(x)\right|<{\tfrac {\pi }{3}}-\delta } for some positive δ. Finally, the formulae for Ai(− x ) and Bi(− x ) are valid if x is in the sector x ∈ C : | arg ⁡ ( x ) | < 2 π 3 − δ . {\displaystyle x\in \mathbb {C} :\left|\arg(x)\right|<{\tfrac {2\pi }{3}}-\delta .} It follows from the asymptotic behaviour of the Airy functions that both Ai( x ) and Bi( x ) have an infinity of zeros on the negative real axis. The function Ai( x ) has no other zeros in the complex plane, while the function Bi( x ) also has infinitely many zeros in the sector z ∈ C : π 3 < | arg ⁡ ( z ) | < π 2 . {\displaystyle z\in \mathbb {C} :{\tfrac {\pi }{3}}<\left|\arg(z)\right|<{\tfrac {\pi }{2}}.} Plots [ edit ] ℜ [ Ai ⁡ ( x + i y ) ] {\displaystyle \Re \left[\operatorname {Ai} (x+iy)\right]} ℑ [ Ai ⁡ ( x + i y ) ] {\displaystyle \Im \left[\operatorname {Ai} (x+iy)\right]} | Ai ⁡ ( x + i y ) | {\displaystyle \left|\operatorname {Ai} (x+iy)\right|\,} arg ⁡ [ Ai ⁡ ( x + i y ) ] {\displaystyle \operatorname {arg} \left[\operatorname {Ai} (x+iy)\right]\,} ℜ [ Bi ⁡ ( x + i y ) ] {\displaystyle \Re \left[\operatorname {Bi} (x+iy)\right]} ℑ [ Bi ⁡ ( x + i y ) ] {\displaystyle \Im \left[\operatorname {Bi} (x+iy)\right]} | Bi ⁡ ( x + i y ) | {\displaystyle \left|\operatorname {Bi} (x+iy)\right|\,} arg ⁡ [ Bi ⁡ ( x + i y ) ] {\displaystyle \operatorname {arg} \left[\operatorname {Bi} (x+iy)\right]\,} Relation to other special functions [ edit ] For positive arguments, the Airy functions are related to the modified Bessel functions : Ai ⁡ ( x ) = 1 π x 3 K 1 / 3 ( 2 3 x 3 / 2 ) , Bi ⁡ ( x ) = x 3 [ I 1 / 3 ( 2 3 x 3 / 2 ) + I − 1 / 3 ( 2 3 x 3 / 2 ) ] . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\operatorname {Ai} (x)&{}={\frac {1}{\pi }}{\sqrt {\frac {x}{3}}}\,K_{1/3}\!\left({\frac {2}{3}}x^{3/2}\right),\\\operatorname {Bi} (x)&{}={\sqrt {\frac {x}{3}}}\left[I_{1/3}\!\left({\frac {2}{3}}x^{3/2}\right)+I_{-1/3}\!\left({\frac {2}{3}}x^{3/2}\right)\right].\end{aligned}}} Here, I ±1/3 and K 1/3 are solutions of x 2 y ″ + x y ′ − ( x 2 + 1 9 ) y = 0. {\displaystyle x^{2}y''+xy'-\left(x^{2}+{\tfrac {1}{9}}\right)y=0.} The first derivative of the Airy function is A i ′ ⁡ ( x ) = − x π 3 K 2 / 3 ( 2 3 x 3 / 2 ) . {\displaystyle \operatorname {Ai'} (x)=-{\frac {x}{\pi {\sqrt {3}}}}\,K_{2/3}\!\left({\frac {2}{3}}x^{3/2}\right).} Functions K 1/3 and K 2/3 can be represented in terms of rapidly convergent integrals [6] (see also modified Bessel functions ) For negative arguments, the Airy function are related to the Bessel functions : Ai ⁡ ( − x ) = x 9 [ J 1 / 3 ( 2 3 x 3 / 2 ) + J − 1 / 3 ( 2 3 x 3 / 2 ) ] , Bi ⁡ ( − x ) = x 3 [ J − 1 / 3 ( 2 3 x 3 / 2 ) − J 1 / 3 ( 2 3 x 3 / 2 ) ] . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\operatorname {Ai} (-x)&{}={\sqrt {\frac {x}{9}}}\left[J_{1/3}\!\left({\frac {2}{3}}x^{3/2}\right)+J_{-1/3}\!\left({\frac {2}{3}}x^{3/2}\right)\right],\\\operatorname {Bi} (-x)&{}={\sqrt {\frac {x}{3}}}\left[J_{-1/3}\!\left({\frac {2}{3}}x^{3/2}\right)-J_{1/3}\!\left({\frac {2}{3}}x^{3/2}\right)\right].\end{aligned}}} Here, J ±1/3 are solutions of x 2 y ″ + x y ′ + ( x 2 − 1 9 ) y = 0. {\displaystyle x^{2}y''+xy'+\left(x^{2}-{\frac {1}{9}}\right)y=0.} The Scorer's functions Hi( x ) and -Gi( x ) solve the equation y ′′ − xy = 1/π . They can also be expressed in terms of the Airy functions: Gi ⁡ ( x ) = Bi ⁡ ( x ) ∫ x ∞ Ai ⁡ ( t ) d t + Ai ⁡ ( x ) ∫ 0 x Bi ⁡ ( t ) d t , Hi ⁡ ( x ) = Bi ⁡ ( x ) ∫ − ∞ x Ai ⁡ ( t ) d t − Ai ⁡ ( x ) ∫ − ∞ x Bi ⁡ ( t ) d t . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\operatorname {Gi} (x)&{}=\operatorname {Bi} (x)\int _{x}^{\infty }\operatorname {Ai} (t)\,dt+\operatorname {Ai} (x)\int _{0}^{x}\operatorname {Bi} (t)\,dt,\\\operatorname {Hi} (x)&{}=\operatorname {Bi} (x)\int _{-\infty }^{x}\operatorname {Ai} (t)\,dt-\operatorname {Ai} (x)\int _{-\infty }^{x}\operatorname {Bi} (t)\,dt.\end{aligned}}} Fourier transform [ edit ] Using the definition of the Airy function Ai( x ), it is straightforward to show its Fourier transform is given by F ( Ai ) ( k ) := ∫ − ∞ ∞ Ai ⁡ ( x ) e − 2 π i k x d x = e i 3 ( 2 π k ) 3 . {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}(\operatorname {Ai} )(k):=\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }\operatorname {Ai} (x)\ e^{-2\pi ikx}\,dx=e^{{\frac {i}{3}}(2\pi k)^{3}}.} This can be obtained by taking the Fourier transform of the Airy equation. Let y ^ = 1 2 π i ∫ y e − i k x d x {\textstyle {\hat {y}}={\frac {1}{2\pi i}}\int ye^{-ikx}dx} , then i y ^ ′ + k 2 y ^ = 0 {\displaystyle i{\hat {y}}'+k^{2}{\hat {y}}=0} , which then has solutions y ^ = C e i k 3 / 3 . {\displaystyle {\hat {y}}=Ce^{ik^{3}/3}.} There only one dimension of solutions because the Fourier transform requires y to decay to zero fast enough, and Bi grows to infinity exponentially fast, so it cannot be obtained via Fourier transform. Applications [ edit ] Quantum mechanics [ edit ] The Airy function is the solution to the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle confined within a triangular potential well and for a particle in a one-dimensional constant force field. For the same reason, it also serves to provide uniform semiclassical approximations near a turning point in the WKB approximation , when the potential may be locally approximated by a linear function of position. The triangular potential well solution is directly relevant for the understanding of electrons trapped in semiconductor heterojunctions . Optics [ edit ] A transversally asymmetric optical beam, where the electric field profile is given by the Airy function, has the interesting property that its maximum intensity accelerates towards one side instead of propagating in a straight line as is the case in symmetric beams. This is at expense of the low-intensity tail being spread in the opposite direction, so the overall momentum of the beam is of course conserved. Caustics [ edit ] The Airy function underlies the form of the intensity near an optical directional caustic , such as that of the rainbow (called supernumerary rainbow). Historically, this was the mathematical problem that led Airy to develop this special function. In 1841, William Hallowes Miller experimentally measured the analog to supernumerary rainbow by shining light through a thin cylinder of water, then observing through a telescope. He observed up to 30 bands. [7] Probability [ edit ] In the mid-1980s, the Airy function was found to be intimately connected to Chernoff's distribution . [8] The Airy function also appears in the definition of Tracy–Widom distribution which describes the law of largest eigenvalues in Random matrix . Due to the intimate connection of random matrix theory with the Kardar–Parisi–Zhang equation , there are central processes constructed in KPZ such as the Airy process. [9] History [ edit ] The Airy function is named after the British astronomer and physicist George Biddell Airy (1801–1892), who encountered it in his early study of optics in physics (Airy 1838). The notation Ai( x ) was introduced by Harold Jeffreys . Airy had become the British Astronomer Royal in 1835, and he held that post until his retirement in 1881.

Definition [ edit ] If we define P σ {\displaystyle P_{\sigma }} as the Leray projection onto divergence free vector fields , then the Stokes Operator A {\displaystyle A} is defined by A := − P σ Δ , {\displaystyle A:=-P_{\sigma }\Delta ,} where Δ ≡ ∇ 2 {\displaystyle \Delta \equiv \nabla ^{2}} is the Laplacian . Since A {\displaystyle A} is unbounded, we must also give its domain of definition, which is defined as D ( A ) = H 2 ∩ V {\displaystyle {\mathcal {D}}(A)=H^{2}\cap V} , where V = { u → ∈ ( H 0 1 ( Ω ) ) n | div u → = 0 } {\displaystyle V=\{{\vec {u}}\in (H_{0}^{1}(\Omega ))^{n}|\operatorname {div} \,{\vec {u}}=0\}} . Here, Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } is a bounded open set in R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} (usually n = 2 or 3), H 2 ( Ω ) {\displaystyle H^{2}(\Omega )} and H 0 1 ( Ω ) {\displaystyle H_{0}^{1}(\Omega )} are the standard Sobolev spaces , and the divergence of u → {\displaystyle {\vec {u}}} is taken in the distribution sense. Properties [ edit ] For a given domain Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } which is open, bounded, and has C 2 {\displaystyle C^{2}} boundary, the Stokes operator A {\displaystyle A} is a self-adjoint positive-definite operator with respect to the L 2 {\displaystyle L^{2}} inner product. It has an orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions { w k } k = 1 ∞ {\displaystyle \{w_{k}\}_{k=1}^{\infty }} corresponding to eigenvalues { λ k } k = 1 ∞ {\displaystyle \{\lambda _{k}\}_{k=1}^{\infty }} which satisfy 0 < λ 1 < λ 2 ≤ λ 3 ⋯ ≤ λ k ≤ ⋯ {\displaystyle 0<\lambda _{1}<\lambda _{2}\leq \lambda _{3}\cdots \leq \lambda _{k}\leq \cdots } and λ k → ∞ {\displaystyle \lambda _{k}\rightarrow \infty } as k → ∞ {\displaystyle k\rightarrow \infty } . Note that the smallest eigenvalue is unique and non-zero. These properties allow one to define powers of the Stokes operator. Let α > 0 {\displaystyle \alpha >0} be a real number. We define A α {\displaystyle A^{\alpha }} by its action on u → ∈ D ( A ) {\displaystyle {\vec {u}}\in {\mathcal {D}}(A)} : A α u → = ∑ k = 1 ∞ λ k α u k w k → {\displaystyle A^{\alpha }{\vec {u}}=\sum _{k=1}^{\infty }\lambda _{k}^{\alpha }u_{k}{\vec {w_{k}}}} where u k := ( u → , w k → ) {\displaystyle u_{k}:=({\vec {u}},{\vec {w_{k}}})} and ( ⋅ , ⋅ ) {\displaystyle (\cdot ,\cdot )} is the L 2 ( Ω ) {\displaystyle L^{2}(\Omega )} inner product. The inverse A − 1 {\displaystyle A^{-1}} of the Stokes operator is a bounded, compact, self-adjoint operator in the space H := { u → ∈ ( L 2 ( Ω ) ) n | div u → = 0 and γ ( u → ) = 0 } {\displaystyle H:=\{{\vec {u}}\in (L^{2}(\Omega ))^{n}|\operatorname {div} \,{\vec {u}}=0{\text{ and }}\gamma ({\vec {u}})=0\}} , where γ {\displaystyle \gamma } is the trace operator . Furthermore, A − 1 : H → V {\displaystyle A^{-1}:H\rightarrow V} is injective.

Diagram of the Stokes shift between absorption and emission light spectra Stokes shift is the difference (in energy , wavenumber or frequency units) between positions of the band maxima of the absorption and emission spectra ( fluorescence and Raman being two examples) of the same electronic transition. [1] It is named after Irish physicist George Gabriel Stokes . [2] [3] [4] For Stokes (left), the molecule is excited from a vibrational energy level (v=0) to a virtual state (j). The Stokes scattering shows that the emitted energy is less than the absorbed. The anti-Stokes (right) shows that emitted energy is more than the absorbed. When a system (be it a molecule or atom ) absorbs a photon , it gains energy and enters an excited state . The system can relax by emitting a photon. The Stokes shift occurs when the energy of the emitted photon is lower than that of the absorbed photon, representing the difference in energy of the two photons. The Stokes shift is primarily the result of two phenomena: vibrational relaxation or dissipation and solvent reorganization. A fluorophore is a part of a molecule with a dipole moment that exhibits fluorescence. When a fluorophore enters an excited state, its dipole moment changes, but surrounding solvent molecules cannot adjust so quickly. Only after vibrational relaxation do their dipole moments realign. [5] Stokes shifts are given in wavelength units, but this is less meaningful than energy, wavenumber or frequency units because it depends on the absorption wavelength. For instance, a 50 nm Stokes shift from absorption at 300 nm is larger in terms of energy than a 50 nm Stokes shift from absorption at 600 nm. Stokes fluorescence [ edit ] Absorption and emission spectra of rhodamine 6G with ~25 nm Stokes shift Stokes fluorescence is the emission of a longer-wavelength photon (lower frequency or energy) by a molecule that has absorbed a photon of shorter wavelength (higher frequency or energy). [6] [7] [8] Both absorption and radiation (emission) of energy are distinctive for a particular molecular structure. If a material has a direct bandgap in the range of visible light, the light shining on it is absorbed, which excites electrons to a higher-energy state. The electrons remain in the excited state for about 10 −8 seconds. This number varies over several orders of magnitude, depending on the sample, and is known as the fluorescence lifetime of the sample. After losing a small amount of energy through vibrational relaxation, the molecule returns to the ground state, and energy is emitted. Anti-Stokes shift [ edit ] If the emitted photon has more energy than the absorbed photon, the energy difference is called an anti-Stokes shift ; [9] this extra energy comes from dissipation of thermal phonons in a crystal lattice, cooling the crystal in the process. Anti-Stokes shifts may also be due to triplet-triplet annihilation processes, resulting in the formation of higher singlet states that emit at higher energies. Applications of Stokes and anti-Stokes shifts [ edit ] Raman spectroscopy [ edit ] In Raman spectroscopy , when a molecule is excited by incident radiation, it undergoes a Stokes shift as it emits radiation at a lower energy level than the incident radiation. Analyzing the intensity and frequency of the spectral shift provides valuable information about the vibrational modes of molecules, enabling the identification of chemical bonds, functional groups, and molecular conformations. Yttrium oxysulfide [ edit ] Yttrium oxysulfide ( Y 2 O 2 S ) doped with gadolinium oxysulfide ( Gd 2 O 2 S ) is a common industrial anti-Stokes pigment , absorbing in the near-infrared and emitting in the visible region of the spectrum. [10] This composite material is often utilized in luminescent applications, where it absorbs lower-energy photons and emits higher-energy photons. This unique property makes it particularly valuable in various technological fields, including security printing, anti-counterfeiting measures, and luminescent displays. By harnessing anti-Stokes fluorescence, this pigment enables the creation of vibrant and durable inks, coatings, and materials with enhanced visibility and authentication capabilities. Photon upconversion [ edit ] Photon upconversion is an anti-Stokes process where lower-energy photons are converted into higher-energy photons. An example of this later process is demonstrated by upconverting nanoparticles . It is more commonly observed in Raman spectroscopy , where it can be used to determine the temperature of a material. [11] Optoelectronic devices [ edit ] In direct-bandgap thin-film semiconducting layers Stokes shifted emission can originate from three main sources: doping, strain, and disorder. [12] Each of these factors can introduce variations in the energy levels of the semiconductor material, leading to a shift in the emitted light towards longer wavelengths compared to the incident light. This phenomenon is particularly relevant in optoelectronic devices where controlling these factors can be crucial for optimizing device performance.

Born in County Sligo , Ireland, Stokes spent all of his career at the University of Cambridge , where he was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics from 1849 until his death in 1903. As a physicist, Stokes made seminal contributions to fluid mechanics , including the Navier–Stokes equations ; and to physical optics , with notable works on polarization and fluorescence . As a mathematician, he popularised "" Stokes' theorem "" in vector calculus and contributed to the theory of asymptotic expansions . Stokes, along with Felix Hoppe-Seyler , first demonstrated the oxygen transport function of haemoglobin , and showed colour changes produced by the aeration of haemoglobin solutions. Stokes was made a baronet by the British monarch in 1889. In 1893 he received the Royal Society 's Copley Medal , then the most prestigious scientific prize in the world, ""for his researches and discoveries in physical science"". He represented Cambridge University in the British House of Commons from 1887 to 1892, sitting as a Conservative . Stokes also served as president of the Royal Society from 1885 to 1890 and was briefly the Master of Pembroke College, Cambridge . Stokes's extensive correspondence and his work as Secretary of the Royal Society has led him to be referred to as a gatekeeper of Victorian science, with his contributions surpassing his own published papers. [1] Biography [ edit ] George Stokes was the youngest son of the Reverend Gabriel Stokes (died 1834), a clergyman in the Church of Ireland who served as rector of Skreen in County Sligo , and his wife Elizabeth Haughton, daughter of the Reverend John Haughton. Stokes's home life was strongly influenced by his father's evangelical Protestantism: three of his brothers entered the Church, of whom the most eminent was John Whitley Stokes , Archdeacon of Armagh . [2] Alongside a lifelong commitment to his Protestant faith, Stokes's childhood in Skreen had a strong influence on his later decision to pursue fluid dynamics as a research area. [3] His daughter, Isabella Humphreys, wrote that her father ""told me that he was nearly carried away by one of these great waves when bathing as a boy off the coast of Sligo, and this first attracted his attention to waves"". [4] John and George were always close, and George lived with John while attending school in Dublin . Of all his family he was closest to his sister Elizabeth. Their mother was remembered in the family as ""beautiful but very stern"". After attending schools in Skreen, Dublin and Bristol , in 1837 Stokes matriculated at Pembroke College, Cambridge . Four years later he graduated as senior wrangler and first Smith's prizeman , achievements that earned him election as a fellow of the college. [5] In accordance with the college statutes, Stokes had to resign the fellowship when he married in 1857. Twelve years later, under new statutes, he was re-elected to the fellowship and he retained that place until 1902, when on the day before his 83rd birthday, he was elected as the college's Master. Stokes did not hold that position for long, for he died at Cambridge on 1 February the following year, [6] and was buried in the Mill Road cemetery . There is also a memorial to him in the north aisle at Westminster Abbey . [7] Career [ edit ] In 1849, Stokes was appointed to the Lucasian professorship of mathematics at Cambridge, a position he held until his death in 1903. On 1 June 1899, the jubilee of this appointment was celebrated there in a ceremony attended by numerous delegates from European and American universities. A commemorative gold medal was presented to Stokes by the chancellor of the university and marble busts of Stokes by Hamo Thornycroft were formally offered to Pembroke College and to the university by Lord Kelvin . At 54 years, Stokes's tenure as the Lucasian Professor was the longest in history. Stokes, who was made a baronet in 1889, further served his university by representing it in parliament from 1887 to 1892 as one of the two members for the Cambridge University constituency . In 1885–1890 he was also president of the Royal Society , of which he had been one of the secretaries since 1854. As he was also Lucasian Professor at this time, Stokes was the first person to hold all three positions simultaneously; Newton held the same three, although not at the same time. [6] Stokes was the oldest of the trio of natural philosophers, James Clerk Maxwell and Lord Kelvin being the other two, who especially contributed to the fame of the Cambridge school of mathematical physics in the middle of the 19th century. Stokes's original work began about 1840, and is distinguished for its quantity and quality. The Royal Society's catalogue of scientific papers gives the titles of over a hundred memoirs by him published down to 1883. Some of these are only brief notes, others are short controversial or corrective statements, but many are long and elaborate treatises. [8] Contributions to science [ edit ] Stokes at a later age In scope, Stokes's work covered a wide range of physical inquiry but, as Marie Alfred Cornu remarked in his Rede Lecture of 1899, [9] the greater part of it was concerned with waves and the transformations imposed on them during their passage through various media. [10] Fluid dynamics [ edit ] Stokes's first published papers, which appeared in 1842 and 1843, were on the steady motion of incompressible fluids and some cases of fluid motion. [11] [12] These were followed in 1845 by one on the friction of fluids in motion and the equilibrium and motion of elastic solids, [13] and in 1850 by another on the effects of the internal friction of fluids on the motion of pendulums . [14] To the theory of sound he made several contributions, including a discussion of the effect of wind on the intensity of sound [15] and an explanation of how the intensity is influenced by the nature of the gas in which the sound is produced. [16] These inquiries together put the science of fluid dynamics on a new footing, and provided a key not only to the explanation of many natural phenomena, such as the suspension of clouds in the air, and the subsidence of ripples and waves in water, but also to the solution of practical problems, such as the flow of water in rivers and channels, and the skin resistance of ships. [10] Creeping flow [ edit ] Main article: Stokes' law Creeping flow past a sphere: streamlines and forces. Stokes's work on fluid motion and viscosity led to his calculating the terminal velocity for a sphere falling in a viscous medium. This became known as Stokes' law . He derived an expression for the frictional force (also called drag force ) exerted on spherical objects with very small Reynolds numbers . [17] His work is the basis of the falling sphere viscometer , in which the fluid is stationary in a vertical glass tube. A sphere of known size and density is allowed to descend through the liquid. If correctly selected, it reaches terminal velocity , which can be measured by the time it takes to pass two marks on the tube. Electronic sensing can be used for opaque fluids. Knowing the terminal velocity, the size and density of the sphere, and the density of the liquid, Stokes's law can be used to calculate the viscosity of the fluid. A series of steel ball bearings of different diameters is normally used in the classic experiment to improve the accuracy of the calculation. The school experiment uses glycerine as the fluid, and the technique is used industrially to check the viscosity of fluids used in processes. [ citation needed ] The same theory explains why small water droplets (or ice crystals) can remain suspended in air (as clouds) until they grow to a critical size and start falling as rain (or snow and hail ). Similar use of the equation can be made in the settlement of fine particles in water or other fluids. [ citation needed ] "" stokes "", the CGS unit of kinematic viscosity , was named in recognition of his work. Light [ edit ] Perhaps his best-known researches are those which deal with the wave theory of light. His optical work began at an early period in his scientific career. His first papers on the aberration of light appeared in 1845 and 1846, [18] [19] and were followed in 1848 by one on the theory of certain bands seen in the spectrum . [20] [10] In 1849 he published a long paper on the dynamical theory of diffraction , in which he showed that the plane of polarisation must be perpendicular to the direction of propagation. [21] Two years later he discussed the colours of thick plates. [22] [10] Stokes also investigated George Airy 's mathematical description of rainbows . [23] Airy's findings involved an integral that was awkward to evaluate. Stokes expressed the integral as a divergent series , which were little understood. However, by cleverly truncating the series (i.e., ignoring all except the first few terms of the series), Stokes obtained an accurate approximation to the integral that was far easier to evaluate than the integral itself. [24] Stokes's research on asymptotic series led to fundamental insights about such series. [25] Fluorescence [ edit ] Fluorspar In 1852, in his famous paper on the change of wavelength of light, he described the phenomenon of fluorescence , as exhibited by fluorspar and uranium glass , materials which he viewed as having the power to convert invisible ultra-violet radiation into radiation of longer wavelengths that are visible. [26] The Stokes shift , which describes this conversion, is named in Stokes's honour. A mechanical model, illustrating the dynamical principle of Stokes's explanation was shown. The offshoot of this, Stokes line , is the basis of Raman scattering . In 1883, during a lecture at the Royal Institution , Lord Kelvin said he had heard an account of it from Stokes many years before, and had repeatedly but vainly begged him to publish it. [27] Polarization [ edit ] A calcite crystal laid upon a paper with some letters showing the double refraction In the same year, 1852, there appeared the paper on the composition and resolution of streams of polarised light from different sources, [28] and in 1853 an investigation of the metallic reflection exhibited by certain non-metallic substances. [29] The research was to highlight the phenomenon of light polarisation . About 1860 he was engaged in an inquiry on the intensity of light reflected from, or transmitted through, a pile of plates; [30] and in 1862 he prepared for the British Association a valuable report on double refraction , [10] a phenomenon where certain crystals show different refractive indices along different axes. [31] Perhaps the best known crystal is Iceland spar , transparent calcite crystals. A paper on the long spectrum of the electric light bears the same date, [32] and was followed by an inquiry into the absorption spectrum of blood. [10] [33] Chemical analysis [ edit ] The chemical identification of organic bodies by their optical properties was treated in 1864; [34] and later, in conjunction with the Rev. William Vernon Harcourt , he investigated the relation between the chemical composition and the optical properties of various glasses, with reference to the conditions of transparency and the improvement of achromatic telescopes . [35] A still later paper connected with the construction of optical instruments discussed the theoretical limits to the aperture of microscope objectives. [36] [10] Ophthalmology [ edit ] In 1849, Stokes invented the Stokes lens to detect astigmatism . [37] It is a lens combination consisted of equal but opposite power cylindrical lenses attached together in such a way so that the lenses can be rotated relative to one another. [38] Other work [ edit ] Crookes Radiometer In other areas of physics may be mentioned his paper on the conduction of heat in crystals (1851) [39] and his inquiries in connection with Crookes radiometer ; [40] his explanation of the light border frequently noticed in photographs just outside the outline of a dark body seen against the sky (1882); [41] and, still later, his theory of the x-rays , which he suggested might be transverse waves travelling as innumerable solitary waves, not in regular trains. [42] Two long papers published in 1849 – one on attractions and Clairaut's theorem , [43] and the other on the variation of gravity at the surface of the Earth (1849) – Stokes's gravity formula [44] —also demand notice, as do his mathematical memoirs on the critical values of sums of periodic series (1847) [45] and on the numerical calculation of a class of definite integrals and infinite series (1850) [46] and his discussion of a differential equation relating to the breaking of railway bridges (1849), [47] [10] research related to his evidence given to the Royal Commission on the Use of Iron in Railway structures after the Dee Bridge disaster of 1847. Unpublished research [ edit ] Many of Stokes's discoveries were not published, or were only touched upon in the course of his oral lectures. One such example is his work in the theory of spectroscopy . [10] Lord Kelvin In his presidential address to the British Association in 1871, Lord Kelvin stated his belief that the application of the prismatic analysis of light to solar and stellar chemistry had never been suggested directly or indirectly by anyone else when Stokes taught it to him at Cambridge University some time prior to the summer of 1852, and he set forth the conclusions, theoretical and practical, which he learnt from Stokes at that time, and which he afterwards gave regularly in his public lectures at Glasgow . [48] Kirchhoff These statements, containing as they do the physical basis on which spectroscopy rests, and the way in which it is applicable to the identification of substances existing in the sun and stars, make it appear that Stokes anticipated Gustav Kirchhoff by at least seven or eight years. Stokes, however, in a letter published some years after the delivery of this address, stated that he had failed to take one essential step in the argument—not perceiving that emission of light of definite wavelength not merely permitted, but necessitated, absorption of light of the same wavelength. He modestly disclaimed ""any part of Kirchhoff's admirable discovery,"" adding that he felt some of his friends had been over-zealous in his cause. [49] It must be said, however, that English men of science have not accepted this disclaimer in all its fullness, and still attribute to Stokes the credit of having first enunciated the fundamental principles of spectroscopy . [10] In another way, too, Stokes did much for the progress of mathematical physics. Soon after he was elected to the Lucasian chair he announced that he regarded it as part of his professional duties to help any member of the university with difficulties he might encounter in his mathematical studies, and the assistance rendered was so real that pupils were glad to consult him, even after they had become colleagues, on mathematical and physical problems in which they found themselves at a loss. Then during the thirty years he acted as secretary of the Royal Society, he exercised an enormous if inconspicuous influence on the advancement of mathematical and physical science, not only directly by his own investigations, but indirectly by suggesting problems for inquiry and inciting men to attack them, and by his readiness to give encouragement and help. [10] Contributions to engineering [ edit ] The Dee Bridge after its collapse Stokes was involved in several investigations into railway accidents, especially the Dee Bridge disaster in May 1847, and he served as a member of the subsequent Royal Commission into the use of cast iron in railway structures. He contributed to the calculation of the forces exerted by moving engines on bridges. The bridge failed because a cast iron beam was used to support the loads of passing trains. Cast iron is brittle in tension or bending , and many other similar bridges had to be demolished or reinforced. Fallen Tay Bridge from the north He appeared as an expert witness at the Tay Bridge disaster , where he gave evidence about the effects of wind loads on the bridge. The centre section of the bridge (known as the High Girders) was completely destroyed during a storm on 28 December 1879, while an express train was in the section, and everyone aboard died (more than 75 victims). The Board of Inquiry listened to many expert witnesses , and concluded that the bridge was ""badly designed, badly built and badly maintained"". [50] As a result of his evidence, he was appointed a member of the subsequent Royal Commission into the effect of wind pressure on structures. The effects of high winds on large structures had been neglected at that time, and the commission conducted a series of measurements across Britain to gain an appreciation of wind speeds during storms, and the pressures they exerted on exposed surfaces. Work on religion [ edit ] Skreen , Church of Ireland in County Sligo Stokes generally held conservative religious values and beliefs. In 1886, he became president of the Victoria Institute , which had been founded to defend evangelical Christian principles against challenges from the new sciences, especially the Darwinian theory of biological evolution . He gave the 1891 Gifford lecture on natural theology . [51] [52] He was also the vice-president of the British and Foreign Bible Society and was actively involved in doctrinal debates concerning missionary work. [53] However, although his religious views were mostly orthodox, he was unusual among Victorian evangelicals in rejecting eternal punishment in hell, and instead was a proponent of Christian conditionalism . [54] As President of the Victoria Institute, Stokes wrote: ""We all admit that the book of Nature and the book of Revelation come alike from God, and that consequently there can be no real discrepancy between the two if rightly interpreted. The provisions of Science and Revelation are, for the most part, so distinct that there is little chance of collision. But if an apparent discrepancy should arise, we have no right on principle, to exclude either in favour of the other. For however firmly convinced we may be of the truth of revelation, we must admit our liability to err as to the extent or interpretation of what is revealed; and however strong the scientific evidence in favour of a theory may be, we must remember that we are dealing with evidence which, in its nature, is probable only, and it is conceivable that wider scientific knowledge might lead us to alter our opinion"". [55] Personal life [ edit ] Stokes married Mary Susanna Robinson, the only daughter of Irish astronomer Rev Thomas Romney Robinson , at St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh on 4 July 1857. They had five children: Arthur Romney, who inherited the baronetcy; Susanna Elizabeth, who died in infancy; Isabella Lucy (Mrs Laurence Humphry) who contributed the personal memoir of her father in ""Memoir and Scientific Correspondence of the Late George Gabriel Stokes, Bart""; Dr William George Gabriel, physician, a troubled man who committed suicide aged 30 while temporarily insane; and Dora Susanna, who died in infancy. His male line and hence his baronetcy have since become extinct. Legacy and honours [ edit ] Further information: List of things named after George Gabriel Stokes Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University From the Royal Society , of which he became a fellow in 1851, he received the Rumford Medal in 1852 in recognition of his inquiries into the wavelength of light, and later, in 1893, the Copley Medal . In 1869 he presided over the Exeter meeting of the British Association. In 1874 he was elected an International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences [56] In 1883 he was elected an International Member of the United States National Academy of Sciences [57] From 1883 to 1885 he was Burnett lecturer at Aberdeen , his lectures on light, which were published in 1884–1887, dealt with its nature, its use as a means of investigation, and its beneficial effects. [10] On 18 April 1888 he was admitted as a Freeman of the City of London. [58] On 6 July 1889 Queen Victoria made him a Baronet as Sir George Gabriel Stokes of Lensfield Cottage in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom ; the title became extinct in 1916. [59] In 1889, he was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society . [60] In 1891, as Gifford lecturer, he published a volume on Natural Theology. Member of the Prussian Order Pour le Mérite His academic distinctions included honorary degrees from many universities, including Doctor mathematicae ( honoris causa ) from the Royal Frederick University on 6 September 1902, when they celebrated the centennial of the birth of mathematician Niels Henrik Abel . [61] [62] The stokes , a unit of kinematic viscosity , is named after him. In 1909, the Stokes Society at Pembroke College was founded as an academic hub for undergraduate scientists across the University. It remains active as of 2023. [63] In July 2017, Dublin City University named a building after Stokes in recognition of his contributions to physics and mathematics. [64] Publications [ edit ] Stokes's mathematical and physical papers (see external links) were published in a collected form in five volumes; the first three (Cambridge, 1880, 1883, and 1901) under his own editorship, and the two last (Cambridge, 1904 and 1905) under that of Sir Joseph Larmor , who also selected and arranged the Memoir and Scientific Correspondence of Stokes published at Cambridge in 1907.

( December 2019 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) This article provides an error analysis of time discretization applied to spatially discrete approximation of the stationary and nonstationary Navier-Stokes equations . The nonlinearity of the convection term is the main problem in solving a stationary or nonstationary Navier-Stokes equation or Euler equation problems. Stoke incorporated ‘the method of artificial compressibility’ to solve these problems. Navier-Stokes equation [ edit ] ρ ( ∂ v ∂ t + v ⋅ ∇ v ) = − ∇ p + μ ∇ 2 v + f . {\displaystyle \rho \left({\frac {\partial \mathbf {v} }{\partial t}}+\mathbf {v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf {v} \right)=-\nabla p+\mu \nabla ^{2}\mathbf {v} +\mathbf {f} .} Stokes approximation [ edit ] The Stokes approximation is developed from the Navier-Stokes equations by omission of the convective term. For small Reynolds numbers in the incompressible flow, this approximation is more useful. Then incompressible Navier Stokes equation can be written as- R e . ∂ t u ~ + R e . ⟨ u ~ , ∇ ~ ⟩ u ~ + R e . ∇ p ~ − Δ ~ u ~ = 0 {\displaystyle R_{e}.\partial _{t}{\tilde {u}}+R_{e}.\left\langle {\tilde {u}},{\tilde {\nabla }}\right\rangle {\tilde {u}}+R_{e}.\nabla {\tilde {p}}-{\tilde {\Delta }}{\tilde {u}}=0} . Here linear diffusion term dominates the convection term. In the stationary problem neglecting the convection term, we get- R e . ∇ p − Δ u = 0 {\displaystyle R_{e}.\nabla p-\Delta u=0} Many theorems can be proved by using this process. The main problem with the solution of the incompressible flow equation is the decoupling of the continuity and momentum equation due to the absence of pressure or density term. Chorin proposed the solution for this problem of the pressure decoupling; this approach is called artificial compressibility. ∂ t ψ − L [ ψ ] = 0 where ψ = ( u 1 , u 2 , u 3 , p ) T {\displaystyle \partial _{t}\psi -L[\psi ]=0{\text{ where }}\psi =(u_{1},u_{2},u_{3},p)^{T}} In the above equation stoke assume that at, non-stationary Navier Stokes problem converge towards the solution of the correspondent stationary problem. This solution will not depend upon the function . If this is used for the above equation consisting of Navier stokes equation and continuity equations with time derivative of pressure, then the solution will be same as the stationary solution of the original Navier Stoke problem. This process also introduce the new term artificial time as t→∞. Artificial compressibility method is combined with a dual time stepping procedure which involves iteration in pseudo-time within each physical time step. This guarantees a convergence towards the solution for the incompressible flow problem.

Terminal velocity is achieved when the drag force is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the force propelling the object. Shown is a sphere in Stokes flow, at very low Reynolds number . Stokes flow (named after George Gabriel Stokes ), also named creeping flow or creeping motion , [1] is a type of fluid flow where advective inertial forces are small compared with viscous forces. [2] The Reynolds number is low, i.e. R e ≪ 1 {\displaystyle \mathrm {Re} \ll 1} . This is a typical situation in flows where the fluid velocities are very slow, the viscosities are very large, or the length-scales of the flow are very small. Creeping flow was first studied to understand lubrication . In nature, this type of flow occurs in the swimming of microorganisms and sperm . [3] In technology, it occurs in paint , MEMS devices, and in the flow of viscous polymers generally. The equations of motion for Stokes flow, called the Stokes equations, are a linearization of the Navier–Stokes equations , and thus can be solved by a number of well-known methods for linear differential equations. [4] The primary Green's function of Stokes flow is the Stokeslet , which is associated with a singular point force embedded in a Stokes flow. From its derivatives, other fundamental solutions can be obtained. [5] The Stokeslet was first derived by Oseen in 1927, although it was not named as such until 1953 by Hancock. [6] The closed-form fundamental solutions for the generalized unsteady Stokes and Oseen flows associated with arbitrary time-dependent translational and rotational motions have been derived for the Newtonian [7] and micropolar [8] fluids. Stokes equations [ edit ] The equation of motion for Stokes flow can be obtained by linearizing the steady state Navier–Stokes equations . The inertial forces are assumed to be negligible in comparison to the viscous forces, and eliminating the inertial terms of the momentum balance in the Navier–Stokes equations reduces it to the momentum balance in the Stokes equations: [1] ∇ ⋅ σ + f = 0 {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\cdot \sigma +\mathbf {f} ={\boldsymbol {0}}} where σ {\displaystyle \sigma } is the stress (sum of viscous and pressure stresses), [9] [10] and f {\displaystyle \mathbf {f} } an applied body force. The full Stokes equations also include an equation for the conservation of mass , commonly written in the form: ∂ ρ ∂ t + ∇ ⋅ ( ρ u ) = 0 {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \rho }{\partial t}}+\nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf {u} )=0} where ρ {\displaystyle \rho } is the fluid density and u {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} } the fluid velocity. To obtain the equations of motion for incompressible flow, it is assumed that the density, ρ {\displaystyle \rho } , is a constant. Furthermore, occasionally one might consider the unsteady Stokes equations, in which the term ρ ∂ u ∂ t {\displaystyle \rho {\frac {\partial \mathbf {u} }{\partial t}}} is added to the left hand side of the momentum balance equation. [1] Properties [ edit ] The Stokes equations represent a considerable simplification of the full Navier–Stokes equations , especially in the incompressible Newtonian case. [2] [4] [9] [10] They are the leading-order simplification of the full Navier–Stokes equations, valid in the distinguished limit R e → 0. {\displaystyle \mathrm {Re} \to 0.} Instantaneity A Stokes flow has no dependence on time other than through time-dependent boundary conditions . This means that, given the boundary conditions of a Stokes flow, the flow can be found without knowledge of the flow at any other time. Time-reversibility An immediate consequence of instantaneity, time-reversibility means that a time-reversed Stokes flow solves the same equations as the original Stokes flow. This property can sometimes be used (in conjunction with linearity and symmetry in the boundary conditions) to derive results about a flow without solving it fully. Time reversibility means that it is difficult to mix two fluids using creeping flow. Time-reversibility of Stokes Flows: Dye has been injected into a viscous fluid sandwiched between two concentric cylinders (top panel). The core cylinder is then rotated to shear the dye into a spiral as viewed from above. The dye appears to be mixed with the fluid viewed from the side (middle panel). The rotation is then reversed bringing the cylinder to its original position. The dye ""unmixes"" (bottom panel). Reversal is not perfect because some diffusion of dye occurs. [11] [12] While these properties are true for incompressible Newtonian Stokes flows, the non-linear and sometimes time-dependent nature of non-Newtonian fluids means that they do not hold in the more general case. Stokes paradox [ edit ] An interesting property of Stokes flow is known as the Stokes' paradox : that there can be no Stokes flow of a fluid around a disk in two dimensions; or, equivalently, the fact there is no non-trivial solution for the Stokes equations around an infinitely long cylinder. [13] Demonstration of time-reversibility [ edit ] A Taylor–Couette system can create laminar flows in which concentric cylinders of fluid move past each other in an apparent spiral. [14] A fluid such as corn syrup with high viscosity fills the gap between two cylinders, with colored regions of the fluid visible through the transparent outer cylinder. The cylinders are rotated relative to one another at a low speed, which together with the high viscosity of the fluid and thinness of the gap gives a low Reynolds number , so that the apparent mixing of colors is actually laminar and can then be reversed to approximately the initial state. This creates a dramatic demonstration of seemingly mixing a fluid and then unmixing it by reversing the direction of the mixer. [15] [16] [17] Incompressible flow of Newtonian fluids [ edit ] In the common case of an incompressible Newtonian fluid , the Stokes equations take the (vectorized) form: μ ∇ 2 u − ∇ p + f = 0 ∇ ⋅ u = 0 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mu \nabla ^{2}\mathbf {u} -{\boldsymbol {\nabla }}p+\mathbf {f} &={\boldsymbol {0}}\\{\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\cdot \mathbf {u} &=0\end{aligned}}} where u {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} } is the velocity of the fluid, ∇ p {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\nabla }}p} is the gradient of the pressure , μ {\displaystyle \mu } is the dynamic viscosity, and f {\displaystyle \mathbf {f} } an applied body force. The resulting equations are linear in velocity and pressure, and therefore can take advantage of a variety of linear differential equation solvers. [4] Cartesian coordinates [ edit ] With the velocity vector expanded as u = ( u , v , w ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} =(u,v,w)} and similarly the body force vector f = ( f x , f y , f z ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {f} =(f_{x},f_{y},f_{z})} , we may write the vector equation explicitly, μ ( ∂ 2 u ∂ x 2 + ∂ 2 u ∂ y 2 + ∂ 2 u ∂ z 2 ) − ∂ p ∂ x + f x = 0 μ ( ∂ 2 v ∂ x 2 + ∂ 2 v ∂ y 2 + ∂ 2 v ∂ z 2 ) − ∂ p ∂ y + f y = 0 μ ( ∂ 2 w ∂ x 2 + ∂ 2 w ∂ y 2 + ∂ 2 w ∂ z 2 ) − ∂ p ∂ z + f z = 0 ∂ u ∂ x + ∂ v ∂ y + ∂ w ∂ z = 0 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mu \left({\frac {\partial ^{2}u}{\partial x^{2}}}+{\frac {\partial ^{2}u}{\partial y^{2}}}+{\frac {\partial ^{2}u}{\partial z^{2}}}\right)-{\frac {\partial p}{\partial x}}+f_{x}&=0\\\mu \left({\frac {\partial ^{2}v}{\partial x^{2}}}+{\frac {\partial ^{2}v}{\partial y^{2}}}+{\frac {\partial ^{2}v}{\partial z^{2}}}\right)-{\frac {\partial p}{\partial y}}+f_{y}&=0\\\mu \left({\frac {\partial ^{2}w}{\partial x^{2}}}+{\frac {\partial ^{2}w}{\partial y^{2}}}+{\frac {\partial ^{2}w}{\partial z^{2}}}\right)-{\frac {\partial p}{\partial z}}+f_{z}&=0\\{\partial u \over \partial x}+{\partial v \over \partial y}+{\partial w \over \partial z}&=0\end{aligned}}} We arrive at these equations by making the assumptions that P = μ ( ∇ u + ( ∇ u ) T ) − p I {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} =\mu \left({\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\mathbf {u} +({\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\mathbf {u} )^{\mathsf {T}}\right)-p\mathbb {I} } and the density ρ {\displaystyle \rho } is a constant. [9] Methods of solution [ edit ] By stream function [ edit ] The equation for an incompressible Newtonian Stokes flow can be solved by the stream function method in planar or in 3-D axisymmetric cases Type of function Geometry Equation Comments Stream function , ψ {\displaystyle \psi } 2-D planar ∇ 4 ψ = 0 {\displaystyle \nabla ^{4}\psi =0} or Δ 2 ψ = 0 {\displaystyle \Delta ^{2}\psi =0} ( biharmonic equation ) Δ {\displaystyle \Delta } is the Laplacian operator in two dimensions Stokes stream function , Ψ {\displaystyle \Psi } 3-D spherical E 2 Ψ = 0 , {\displaystyle E^{2}\Psi =0,} where E = ∂ 2 ∂ r 2 + sin ⁡ θ r 2 ∂ ∂ θ ( 1 sin ⁡ θ ∂ ∂ θ ) {\displaystyle E={\partial ^{2} \over \partial r^{2}}+{\sin {\theta } \over r^{2}}{\partial \over \partial \theta }\left({1 \over \sin {\theta }}{\partial \over \partial \theta }\right)} For derivation of the E {\displaystyle E} operator see Stokes stream function#Vorticity 3-D cylindrical L − 1 2 Ψ = 0 , {\displaystyle L_{-1}^{2}\Psi =0,} where L − 1 = ∂ 2 ∂ z 2 + ∂ 2 ∂ ρ 2 − 1 ρ ∂ ∂ ρ {\displaystyle L_{-1}={\frac {\partial ^{2}}{\partial z^{2}}}+{\frac {\partial ^{2}}{\partial \rho ^{2}}}-{\frac {1}{\rho }}{\frac {\partial }{\partial \rho }}} For L − 1 {\displaystyle L_{-1}} see [18] By Green's function: the Stokeslet [ edit ] The linearity of the Stokes equations in the case of an incompressible Newtonian fluid means that a Green's function , J ( r ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {J} (\mathbf {r} )} , exists. The Green's function is found by solving the Stokes equations with the forcing term replaced by a point force acting at the origin, and boundary conditions vanishing at infinity: μ ∇ 2 u − ∇ p = − F ⋅ δ ( r ) ∇ ⋅ u = 0 | u | , p → 0 as r → ∞ {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mu \nabla ^{2}\mathbf {u} -{\boldsymbol {\nabla }}p&=-\mathbf {F} \cdot \mathbf {\delta } (\mathbf {r} )\\{\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\cdot \mathbf {u} &=0\\|\mathbf {u} |,p&\to 0\quad {\mbox{as}}\quad r\to \infty \end{aligned}}} where δ ( r ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {\delta } (\mathbf {r} )} is the Dirac delta function , and F ⋅ δ ( r ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} \cdot \delta (\mathbf {r} )} represents a point force acting at the origin. The solution for the pressure p and velocity u with | u | and p vanishing at infinity is given by [1] u ( r ) = F ⋅ J ( r ) , p ( r ) = F ⋅ r 4 π | r | 3 {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} (\mathbf {r} )=\mathbf {F} \cdot \mathbb {J} (\mathbf {r} ),\qquad p(\mathbf {r} )={\frac {\mathbf {F} \cdot \mathbf {r} }{4\pi |\mathbf {r} |^{3}}}} where J ( r ) = 1 8 π μ ( I | r | + r r | r | 3 ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {J} (\mathbf {r} )={1 \over 8\pi \mu }\left({\frac {\mathbb {I} }{|\mathbf {r} |}}+{\frac {\mathbf {r} \mathbf {r} }{|\mathbf {r} |^{3}}}\right)} is a second-rank tensor (or more accurately tensor field ) known as the Oseen tensor (after Carl Wilhelm Oseen ). Here, r r is a quantity such that F ⋅ ( r r ) = ( F ⋅ r ) r {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} \cdot (\mathbf {r} \mathbf {r} )=(\mathbf {F} \cdot \mathbf {r} )\mathbf {r} } . [ clarification needed ] The terms Stokeslet and point-force solution are used to describe F ⋅ J ( r ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} \cdot \mathbb {J} (\mathbf {r} )} . Analogous to the point charge in electrostatics , the Stokeslet is force-free everywhere except at the origin, where it contains a force of strength F {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} } . For a continuous-force distribution (density) f ( r ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {f} (\mathbf {r} )} the solution (again vanishing at infinity) can then be constructed by superposition: u ( r ) = ∫ f ( r ′ ) ⋅ J ( r − r ′ ) d r ′ , p ( r ) = ∫ f ( r ′ ) ⋅ ( r − r ′ ) 4 π | r − r ′ | 3 d r ′ {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} (\mathbf {r} )=\int \mathbf {f} \left(\mathbf {r'} \right)\cdot \mathbb {J} \left(\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {r'} \right)\mathrm {d} \mathbf {r'} ,\qquad p(\mathbf {r} )=\int {\frac {\mathbf {f} \left(\mathbf {r'} \right)\cdot \left(\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {r'} \right)}{4\pi \left|\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {r'} \right|^{3}}}\,\mathrm {d} \mathbf {r'} } This integral representation of the velocity can be viewed as a reduction in dimensionality: from the three-dimensional partial differential equation to a two-dimensional integral equation for unknown densities. [1] By Papkovich–Neuber solution [ edit ] The Papkovich–Neuber solution represents the velocity and pressure fields of an incompressible Newtonian Stokes flow in terms of two harmonic potentials. By boundary element method [ edit ] Certain problems, such as the evolution of the shape of a bubble in a Stokes flow, are conducive to numerical solution by the boundary element method . This technique can be applied to both 2- and 3-dimensional flows. Some geometries [ edit ] Hele-Shaw flow [ edit ] Hele-Shaw flow is an example of a geometry for which inertia forces are negligible. It is defined by two parallel plates arranged very close together with the space between the plates occupied partly by fluid and partly by obstacles in the form of cylinders with generators normal to the plates. [9] Slender-body theory [ edit ] Slender-body theory in Stokes flow is a simple approximate method of determining the irrotational flow field around bodies whose length is large compared with their width. The basis of the method is to choose a distribution of flow singularities along a line (since the body is slender) so that their irrotational flow in combination with a uniform stream approximately satisfies the zero normal velocity condition. [9] Spherical coordinates [ edit ] Lamb 's general solution arises from the fact that the pressure p {\displaystyle p} satisfies the Laplace equation , and can be expanded in a series of solid spherical harmonics in spherical coordinates. As a result, the solution to the Stokes equations can be written: u = ∑ n = − ∞ , n ≠ − 1 n = ∞ [ ( n + 3 ) r 2 ∇ p n 2 μ ( n + 1 ) ( 2 n + 3 ) − n x p n μ ( n + 1 ) ( 2 n + 3 ) ] + . . . ∑ n = − ∞ n = ∞ [ ∇ Φ n + ∇ × ( x χ n ) ] p = ∑ n = − ∞ n = ∞ p n {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbf {u} &=\sum _{n=-\infty ,n\neq -1}^{n=\infty }\left[{\frac {(n+3)r^{2}\nabla p_{n}}{2\mu (n+1)(2n+3)}}-{\frac {n\mathbf {x} p_{n}}{\mu (n+1)(2n+3)}}\right]+...\\\sum _{n=-\infty }^{n=\infty }[\nabla \Phi _{n}+\nabla \times (\mathbf {x} \chi _{n})]\\p&=\sum _{n=-\infty }^{n=\infty }p_{n}\end{aligned}}} where p n , Φ n , {\displaystyle p_{n},\Phi _{n},} and χ n {\displaystyle \chi _{n}} are solid spherical harmonics of order n {\displaystyle n} : p n = r n ∑ m = 0 m = n P n m ( cos ⁡ θ ) ( a m n cos ⁡ m ϕ + a ~ m n sin ⁡ m ϕ ) Φ n = r n ∑ m = 0 m = n P n m ( cos ⁡ θ ) ( b m n cos ⁡ m ϕ + b ~ m n sin ⁡ m ϕ ) χ n = r n ∑ m = 0 m = n P n m ( cos ⁡ θ ) ( c m n cos ⁡ m ϕ + c ~ m n sin ⁡ m ϕ ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p_{n}&=r^{n}\sum _{m=0}^{m=n}P_{n}^{m}(\cos \theta )(a_{mn}\cos m\phi +{\tilde {a}}_{mn}\sin m\phi )\\\Phi _{n}&=r^{n}\sum _{m=0}^{m=n}P_{n}^{m}(\cos \theta )(b_{mn}\cos m\phi +{\tilde {b}}_{mn}\sin m\phi )\\\chi _{n}&=r^{n}\sum _{m=0}^{m=n}P_{n}^{m}(\cos \theta )(c_{mn}\cos m\phi +{\tilde {c}}_{mn}\sin m\phi )\end{aligned}}} and the P n m {\displaystyle P_{n}^{m}} are the associated Legendre polynomials . The Lamb's solution can be used to describe the motion of fluid either inside or outside a sphere. For example, it can be used to describe the motion of fluid around a spherical particle with prescribed surface flow, a so-called squirmer , or to describe the flow inside a spherical drop of fluid. For interior flows, the terms with n < 0 {\displaystyle n<0} are dropped, while for exterior flows the terms with n > 0 {\displaystyle n>0} are dropped (often the convention n → − n − 1 {\displaystyle n\to -n-1} is assumed for exterior flows to avoid indexing by negative numbers). [1] Theorems [ edit ] Stokes solution and related Helmholtz theorem [ edit ] See also: Stokes' law The drag resistance to a moving sphere, also known as Stokes' solution is here summarised. Given a sphere of radius a {\displaystyle a} , travelling at velocity U {\displaystyle U} , in a Stokes fluid with dynamic viscosity μ {\displaystyle \mu } , the drag force F D {\displaystyle F_{D}} is given by: [9] F D = 6 π μ a U {\displaystyle F_{D}=6\pi \mu aU} The Stokes solution dissipates less energy than any other solenoidal vector field with the same boundary velocities: this is known as the Helmholtz minimum dissipation theorem . [1] Lorentz reciprocal theorem [ edit ] The Lorentz reciprocal theorem states a relationship between two Stokes flows in the same region. Consider fluid filled region V {\displaystyle V} bounded by surface S {\displaystyle S} . Let the velocity fields u {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} } and u ′ {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} '} solve the Stokes equations in the domain V {\displaystyle V} , each with corresponding stress fields σ {\displaystyle \mathbf {\sigma } } and σ ′ {\displaystyle \mathbf {\sigma } '} . Then the following equality holds: ∫ S u ⋅ ( σ ′ ⋅ n ) d S = ∫ S u ′ ⋅ ( σ ⋅ n ) d S {\displaystyle \int _{S}\mathbf {u} \cdot ({\boldsymbol {\sigma }}'\cdot \mathbf {n} )dS=\int _{S}\mathbf {u} '\cdot ({\boldsymbol {\sigma }}\cdot \mathbf {n} )dS} Where n {\displaystyle \mathbf {n} } is the unit normal on the surface S {\displaystyle S} . The Lorentz reciprocal theorem can be used to show that Stokes flow ""transmits"" unchanged the total force and torque from an inner closed surface to an outer enclosing surface. [1] The Lorentz reciprocal theorem can also be used to relate the swimming speed of a microorganism, such as cyanobacterium , to the surface velocity which is prescribed by deformations of the body shape via cilia or flagella . [19] The Lorentz reciprocal theorem has also been used in the context of elastohydrodynamic theory to derive the lift force exerted on a solid object moving tangent to the surface of an elastic interface at low Reynolds numbers . [20] [21] Faxén's laws [ edit ] Faxén's laws are direct relations that express the multipole moments in terms of the ambient flow and its derivatives. First developed by Hilding Faxén to calculate the force, F {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} } , and torque, T {\displaystyle \mathbf {T} } on a sphere, they take the following form: F = 6 π μ a ( 1 + a 2 6 ∇ 2 ) v ∞ ( x ) | x = 0 − 6 π μ a U T = 8 π μ a 3 ( Ω ∞ ( x ) − ω ) | x = 0 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbf {F} &=6\pi \mu a\left(1+{\frac {a^{2}}{6}}\nabla ^{2}\right)\mathbf {v} ^{\infty }(\mathbf {x} )|_{x=0}-6\pi \mu a\mathbf {U} \\\mathbf {T} &=8\pi \mu a^{3}(\mathbf {\Omega } ^{\infty }(\mathbf {x} )-\mathbf {\omega } )|_{x=0}\end{aligned}}} where μ {\displaystyle \mu } is the dynamic viscosity, a {\displaystyle a} is the particle radius, v ∞ {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} ^{\infty }} is the ambient flow, U {\displaystyle \mathbf {U} } is the speed of the particle, Ω ∞ {\displaystyle \mathbf {\Omega } ^{\infty }} is the angular velocity of the background flow, and ω {\displaystyle \mathbf {\omega } } is the angular velocity of the particle. Faxén's laws can be generalized to describe the moments of other shapes, such as ellipsoids, spheroids, and spherical drops.

They were named after French engineer and physicist Claude-Louis Navier and the Irish physicist and mathematician George Gabriel Stokes . They were developed over several decades of progressively building the theories, from 1822 (Navier) to 1842–1850 (Stokes). The Navier–Stokes equations mathematically express momentum balance for Newtonian fluids and make use of conservation of mass . They are sometimes accompanied by an equation of state relating pressure , temperature and density . [1] They arise from applying Isaac Newton's second law to fluid motion , together with the assumption that the stress in the fluid is the sum of a diffusing viscous term (proportional to the gradient of velocity) and a pressure term—hence describing viscous flow . The difference between them and the closely related Euler equations is that Navier–Stokes equations take viscosity into account while the Euler equations model only inviscid flow . As a result, the Navier–Stokes are a parabolic equation and therefore have better analytic properties, at the expense of having less mathematical structure (e.g. they are never completely integrable ). The Navier–Stokes equations are useful because they describe the physics of many phenomena of scientific and engineering interest. They may be used to model the weather, ocean currents , water flow in a pipe and air flow around a wing . The Navier–Stokes equations, in their full and simplified forms, help with the design of aircraft and cars, the study of blood flow , the design of power stations , the analysis of pollution , and many other problems. Coupled with Maxwell's equations , they can be used to model and study magnetohydrodynamics . The Navier–Stokes equations are also of great interest in a purely mathematical sense. Despite their wide range of practical uses, it has not yet been proven whether smooth solutions always exist in three dimensions—i.e., whether they are infinitely differentiable (or even just bounded) at all points in the domain . This is called the Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness problem. The Clay Mathematics Institute has called this one of the seven most important open problems in mathematics and has offered a US$ 1 million prize for a solution or a counterexample. [2] [3] Flow velocity [ edit ] The solution of the equations is a flow velocity . It is a vector field —to every point in a fluid, at any moment in a time interval, it gives a vector whose direction and magnitude are those of the velocity of the fluid at that point in space and at that moment in time. It is usually studied in three spatial dimensions and one time dimension, although two (spatial) dimensional and steady-state cases are often used as models, and higher-dimensional analogues are studied in both pure and applied mathematics. Once the velocity field is calculated, other quantities of interest such as pressure or temperature may be found using dynamical equations and relations. This is different from what one normally sees in classical mechanics , where solutions are typically trajectories of position of a particle or deflection of a continuum . Studying velocity instead of position makes more sense for a fluid, although for visualization purposes one can compute various trajectories . In particular, the streamlines of a vector field, interpreted as flow velocity, are the paths along which a massless fluid particle would travel. These paths are the integral curves whose derivative at each point is equal to the vector field, and they can represent visually the behavior of the vector field at a point in time. General continuum equations [ edit ] Main article: Derivation of the Navier–Stokes equations See also: Cauchy momentum equation § Conservation form The Navier–Stokes momentum equation can be derived as a particular form of the Cauchy momentum equation , whose general convective form is D u D t = 1 ρ ∇ ⋅ σ + g . {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {D} \mathbf {u} }{\mathrm {D} t}}={\frac {1}{\rho }}\nabla \cdot {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}+\mathbf {g} .} By setting the Cauchy stress tensor σ {\textstyle {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}} to be the sum of a viscosity term τ {\textstyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}} (the deviatoric stress ) and a pressure term − p I {\textstyle -p\mathbf {I} } (volumetric stress), we arrive at Cauchy momentum equation (convective form) ρ D u D t = − ∇ p + ∇ ⋅ τ + ρ f {\displaystyle \rho {\frac {\mathrm {D} \mathbf {u} }{\mathrm {D} t}}=-\nabla p+\nabla \cdot {\boldsymbol {\tau }}+\rho \,\mathbf {f} } where D D t {\textstyle {\frac {\mathrm {D} }{\mathrm {D} t}}} is the material derivative , defined as ∂ ∂ t + u ⋅ ∇ {\textstyle {\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}+\mathbf {u} \cdot \nabla } , ρ {\textstyle \rho } is the (mass) density, u {\textstyle \mathbf {u} } is the flow velocity, ∇ ⋅ {\textstyle \nabla \cdot \,} is the divergence , p {\textstyle p} is the pressure , t {\textstyle t} is time , τ {\textstyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}} is the deviatoric stress tensor , which has order 2, f {\textstyle \mathbf {f} } represents body accelerations acting on the continuum, for example gravity , inertial accelerations , electrostatic accelerations , and so on. In this form, it is apparent that in the assumption of an inviscid fluid – no deviatoric stress – Cauchy equations reduce to the Euler equations . Assuming conservation of mass , with the known properties of divergence and gradient we can use the mass continuity equation, which represents the mass per unit volume of a homogenous fluid with respect to space and time (i.e., material derivative D D t {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathbf {D} }{\mathbf {Dt} }}} ) of any finite volume ( V ) to represent the change of velocity in fluid media: D m D t = ∭ V ( D ρ D t + ρ ( ∇ ⋅ u ) ) d V D ρ D t + ρ ( ∇ ⋅ u ) = ∂ ρ ∂ t + ( ∇ ρ ) ⋅ u + ρ ( ∇ ⋅ u ) = ∂ ρ ∂ t + ∇ ⋅ ( ρ u ) = 0 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\mathbf {D} m}{\mathbf {Dt} }}&={\iiint \limits _{V}}({{\frac {\mathbf {D} \rho }{\mathbf {Dt} }}+\rho (\nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} )})dV\\{\frac {\mathbf {D} \rho }{\mathbf {Dt} }}+\rho (\nabla \cdot {\mathbf {u} })&={\frac {\partial \rho }{\partial t}}+({\nabla \rho })\cdot {\mathbf {u} }+{\rho }(\nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} )={\frac {\partial \rho }{\partial t}}+\nabla \cdot ({\rho \mathbf {u} })=0\end{aligned}}} where D m D t {\textstyle {\frac {\mathrm {D} m}{\mathrm {D} t}}} is the material derivative of mass per unit volume ( density , ρ {\displaystyle \rho } ), ∭ V ( F ( x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , t ) ) d V {\textstyle {\iiint \limits _{V}}(F(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},t))dV} is the mathematical operation for the integration throughout the volume ( V ), ∂ ∂ t {\textstyle {\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}} is the partial derivative mathematical operator, ∇ ⋅ u {\textstyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} \,} is the divergence of the flow velocity ( u {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} } ), which is a scalar field , Note 1 ∇ ρ {\textstyle {\nabla \rho }\,} is the gradient of density ( ρ {\displaystyle \rho } ), which is the vector derivative of a scalar field , Note 1 Note 1 - Refer to the mathematical operator del represented by the nabla ( ∇ {\displaystyle \nabla } ) symbol. to arrive at the conservation form of the equations of motion. This is often written: [4] Cauchy momentum equation (conservation form) ∂ ∂ t ( ρ u ) + ∇ ⋅ ( ρ u ⊗ u ) = − ∇ p + ∇ ⋅ τ + ρ f {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}(\rho \,\mathbf {u} )+\nabla \cdot (\rho \,\mathbf {u} \otimes \mathbf {u} )=-\nabla p+\nabla \cdot {\boldsymbol {\tau }}+\rho \,\mathbf {f} } where ⊗ {\textstyle \otimes } is the outer product of the flow velocity ( u {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} } ): u ⊗ u = u u T {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} \otimes \mathbf {u} =\mathbf {u} \mathbf {u} ^{\mathrm {T} }} The left side of the equation describes acceleration, and may be composed of time-dependent and convective components (also the effects of non-inertial coordinates if present). The right side of the equation is in effect a summation of hydrostatic effects, the divergence of deviatoric stress and body forces (such as gravity). All non-relativistic balance equations, such as the Navier–Stokes equations, can be derived by beginning with the Cauchy equations and specifying the stress tensor through a constitutive relation . By expressing the deviatoric (shear) stress tensor in terms of viscosity and the fluid velocity gradient, and assuming constant viscosity, the above Cauchy equations will lead to the Navier–Stokes equations below. Convective acceleration [ edit ] See also: Cauchy momentum equation § Convective acceleration An example of convection. Though the flow may be steady (time-independent), the fluid decelerates as it moves down the diverging duct (assuming incompressible or subsonic compressible flow), hence there is an acceleration happening over position. A significant feature of the Cauchy equation and consequently all other continuum equations (including Euler and Navier–Stokes) is the presence of convective acceleration: the effect of acceleration of a flow with respect to space. While individual fluid particles indeed experience time-dependent acceleration, the convective acceleration of the flow field is a spatial effect, one example being fluid speeding up in a nozzle. Compressible flow [ edit ] Remark: here, the deviatoric stress tensor is denoted τ {\textstyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}} as it was in the general continuum equations and in the incompressible flow section . The compressible momentum Navier–Stokes equation results from the following assumptions on the Cauchy stress tensor: [5] the stress is Galilean invariant : it does not depend directly on the flow velocity, but only on spatial derivatives of the flow velocity. So the stress variable is the tensor gradient ∇ u {\textstyle \nabla \mathbf {u} } , or more simply the rate-of- strain tensor : ε ( ∇ u ) ≡ 1 2 ∇ u + 1 2 ( ∇ u ) T {\textstyle {\boldsymbol {\varepsilon }}\left(\nabla \mathbf {u} \right)\equiv {\frac {1}{2}}\nabla \mathbf {u} +{\frac {1}{2}}\left(\nabla \mathbf {u} \right)^{T}} the deviatoric stress is linear in this variable: σ ( ε ) = − p I + C : ε {\textstyle {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}({\boldsymbol {\varepsilon }})=-p\mathbf {I} +\mathbf {C} :{\boldsymbol {\varepsilon }}} , where p {\textstyle p} is independent on the strain rate tensor, C {\textstyle \mathbf {C} } is the fourth-order tensor representing the constant of proportionality, called the viscosity or elasticity tensor , and : is the double-dot product . the fluid is assumed to be isotropic , as with gases and simple liquids, and consequently C {\textstyle \mathbf {C} } is an isotropic tensor; furthermore, since the deviatoric stress tensor is symmetric, by Helmholtz decomposition it can be expressed in terms of two scalar Lamé parameters , the second viscosity λ {\textstyle \lambda } and the dynamic viscosity μ {\textstyle \mu } , as it is usual in linear elasticity : Linear stress constitutive equation (expression similar to the one for elastic solid) σ ( ε ) = − p I + λ tr ⁡ ( ε ) I + 2 μ ε {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}({\boldsymbol {\varepsilon }})=-p\mathbf {I} +\lambda \operatorname {tr} ({\boldsymbol {\varepsilon }})\mathbf {I} +2\mu {\boldsymbol {\varepsilon }}} where I {\textstyle \mathbf {I} } is the identity tensor , and tr ⁡ ( ε ) {\textstyle \operatorname {tr} ({\boldsymbol {\varepsilon }})} is the trace of the rate-of-strain tensor. So this decomposition can be explicitly defined as: σ = − p I + λ ( ∇ ⋅ u ) I + μ ( ∇ u + ( ∇ u ) T ) . {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}=-p\mathbf {I} +\lambda (\nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} )\mathbf {I} +\mu \left(\nabla \mathbf {u} +(\nabla \mathbf {u} )^{\mathrm {T} }\right).} Since the trace of the rate-of-strain tensor in three dimensions is the divergence (i.e. rate of expansion) of the flow: tr ⁡ ( ε ) = ∇ ⋅ u . {\displaystyle \operatorname {tr} ({\boldsymbol {\varepsilon }})=\nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} .} Given this relation, and since the trace of the identity tensor in three dimensions is three: tr ⁡ ( I ) = 3. {\displaystyle \operatorname {tr} ({\boldsymbol {I}})=3.} the trace of the stress tensor in three dimensions becomes: tr ⁡ ( σ ) = − 3 p + ( 3 λ + 2 μ ) ∇ ⋅ u . {\displaystyle \operatorname {tr} ({\boldsymbol {\sigma }})=-3p+(3\lambda +2\mu )\nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} .} So by alternatively decomposing the stress tensor into isotropic and deviatoric parts, as usual in fluid dynamics: [6] σ = − [ p − ( λ + 2 3 μ ) ( ∇ ⋅ u ) ] I + μ ( ∇ u + ( ∇ u ) T − 2 3 ( ∇ ⋅ u ) I ) {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}=-\left[p-\left(\lambda +{\tfrac {2}{3}}\mu \right)\left(\nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} \right)\right]\mathbf {I} +\mu \left(\nabla \mathbf {u} +\left(\nabla \mathbf {u} \right)^{\mathrm {T} }-{\tfrac {2}{3}}\left(\nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} \right)\mathbf {I} \right)} Introducing the bulk viscosity ζ {\textstyle \zeta } , ζ ≡ λ + 2 3 μ , {\displaystyle \zeta \equiv \lambda +{\tfrac {2}{3}}\mu ,} we arrive to the linear constitutive equation in the form usually employed in thermal hydraulics : [5] Linear stress constitutive equation (expression used for fluids) σ = − [ p − ζ ( ∇ ⋅ u ) ] I + μ [ ∇ u + ( ∇ u ) T − 2 3 ( ∇ ⋅ u ) I ] {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}=-[p-\zeta (\nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} )]\mathbf {I} +\mu \left[\nabla \mathbf {u} +(\nabla \mathbf {u} )^{\mathrm {T} }-{\tfrac {2}{3}}(\nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} )\mathbf {I} \right]} which can also be arranged in the other usual form: [7] σ = − p I + μ ( ∇ u + ( ∇ u ) T ) + ( ζ − 2 3 μ ) ( ∇ ⋅ u ) I . {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}=-p\mathbf {I} +\mu \left(\nabla \mathbf {u} +(\nabla \mathbf {u} )^{\mathrm {T} }\right)+\left(\zeta -{\frac {2}{3}}\mu \right)(\nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} )\mathbf {I} .} Note that in the compressible case the pressure is no more proportional to the isotropic stress term, since there is the additional bulk viscosity term: p = − 1 3 tr ⁡ ( σ ) + ζ ( ∇ ⋅ u ) {\displaystyle p=-{\frac {1}{3}}\operatorname {tr} ({\boldsymbol {\sigma }})+\zeta (\nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} )} and the deviatoric stress tensor σ ′ {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}'} is still coincident with the shear stress tensor τ {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}} (i.e. the deviatoric stress in a Newtonian fluid has no normal stress components), and it has a compressibility term in addition to the incompressible case, which is proportional to the shear viscosity: σ ′ = τ = μ [ ∇ u + ( ∇ u ) T − 2 3 ( ∇ ⋅ u ) I ] {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}'={\boldsymbol {\tau }}=\mu \left[\nabla \mathbf {u} +(\nabla \mathbf {u} )^{\mathrm {T} }-{\tfrac {2}{3}}(\nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} )\mathbf {I} \right]} Both bulk viscosity ζ {\textstyle \zeta } and dynamic viscosity μ {\textstyle \mu } need not be constant – in general, they depend on two thermodynamics variables if the fluid contains a single chemical species, say for example, pressure and temperature. Any equation that makes explicit one of these transport coefficient in the conservation variables is called an equation of state . [8] The most general of the Navier–Stokes equations become Navier–Stokes momentum equation ( convective form ) ρ D u D t = ρ ( ∂ u ∂ t + ( u ⋅ ∇ ) u ) = − ∇ p + ∇ ⋅ { μ [ ∇ u + ( ∇ u ) T − 2 3 ( ∇ ⋅ u ) I ] } + ∇ [ ζ ( ∇ ⋅ u ) ] + ρ f . {\displaystyle \rho {\frac {\mathrm {D} \mathbf {u} }{\mathrm {D} t}}=\rho \left({\frac {\partial \mathbf {u} }{\partial t}}+(\mathbf {u} \cdot \nabla )\mathbf {u} \right)=-\nabla p+\nabla \cdot \left\{\mu \left[\nabla \mathbf {u} +(\nabla \mathbf {u} )^{\mathrm {T} }-{\tfrac {2}{3}}(\nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} )\mathbf {I} \right]\right\}+\nabla [\zeta (\nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} )]+\rho \mathbf {f} .} in index notation, the equation can be written as [9] Navier–Stokes momentum equation ( index notation ) ρ ( ∂ u i ∂ t + u k ∂ u i ∂ x k ) = − ∂ p ∂ x i + ∂ ∂ x k [ μ ( ∂ u i ∂ x k + ∂ u k ∂ x i − 2 3 δ i k ∂ u l ∂ x l ) ] + ∂ ∂ x i ( ζ ∂ u l ∂ x l ) + ρ f i . {\displaystyle \rho \left({\frac {\partial u_{i}}{\partial t}}+u_{k}{\frac {\partial u_{i}}{\partial x_{k}}}\right)=-{\frac {\partial p}{\partial x_{i}}}+{\frac {\partial }{\partial x_{k}}}\left[\mu \left({\frac {\partial u_{i}}{\partial x_{k}}}+{\frac {\partial u_{k}}{\partial x_{i}}}-{\frac {2}{3}}\delta _{ik}{\frac {\partial u_{l}}{\partial x_{l}}}\right)\right]+{\frac {\partial }{\partial x_{i}}}\left(\zeta {\frac {\partial u_{l}}{\partial x_{l}}}\right)+\rho f_{i}.} The corresponding equation in conservation form can be obtained by considering that, given the mass continuity equation , the left side is equivalent to: ρ D u D t = ∂ ∂ t ( ρ u ) + ∇ ⋅ ( ρ u ⊗ u ) {\displaystyle \rho {\frac {\mathrm {D} \mathbf {u} }{\mathrm {D} t}}={\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}(\rho \mathbf {u} )+\nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf {u} \otimes \mathbf {u} )} To give finally: Navier–Stokes momentum equation (conservative form ) ∂ ∂ t ( ρ u ) + ∇ ⋅ ( ρ u ⊗ u + [ p − ζ ( ∇ ⋅ u ) ] I − μ [ ∇ u + ( ∇ u ) T − 2 3 ( ∇ ⋅ u ) I ] ) = ρ f . {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}(\rho \mathbf {u} )+\nabla \cdot \left(\rho \mathbf {u} \otimes \mathbf {u} +[p-\zeta (\nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} )]\mathbf {I} -\mu \left[\nabla \mathbf {u} +(\nabla \mathbf {u} )^{\mathrm {T} }-{\tfrac {2}{3}}(\nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} )\mathbf {I} \right]\right)=\rho \mathbf {f} .} Apart from its dependence of pressure and temperature, the second viscosity coefficient also depends on the process, that is to say, the second viscosity coefficient is not just a material property. Example: in the case of a sound wave with a definitive frequency that alternatively compresses and expands a fluid element, the second viscosity coefficient depends on the frequency of the wave. This dependence is called the dispersion . In some cases, the second viscosity ζ {\textstyle \zeta } can be assumed to be constant in which case, the effect of the volume viscosity ζ {\textstyle \zeta } is that the mechanical pressure is not equivalent to the thermodynamic pressure : [10] as demonstrated below. ∇ ⋅ ( ∇ ⋅ u ) I = ∇ ( ∇ ⋅ u ) , {\displaystyle \nabla \cdot (\nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} )\mathbf {I} =\nabla (\nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} ),} p ¯ ≡ p − ζ ∇ ⋅ u , {\displaystyle {\bar {p}}\equiv p-\zeta \,\nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} ,} However, this difference is usually neglected most of the time (that is whenever we are not dealing with processes such as sound absorption and attenuation of shock waves, [11] where second viscosity coefficient becomes important) by explicitly assuming ζ = 0 {\textstyle \zeta =0} . The assumption of setting ζ = 0 {\textstyle \zeta =0} is called as the Stokes hypothesis . [12] The validity of Stokes hypothesis can be demonstrated for monoatomic gas both experimentally and from the kinetic theory; [13] for other gases and liquids, Stokes hypothesis is generally incorrect. With the Stokes hypothesis, the Navier–Stokes equations become Navier–Stokes momentum equation ( convective form, Stokes hypothesis ) ρ D u D t = ρ ( ∂ u ∂ t + ( u ⋅ ∇ ) u ) = − ∇ p + ∇ ⋅ { μ [ ∇ u + ( ∇ u ) T − 2 3 ( ∇ ⋅ u ) I ] } + ρ f . {\displaystyle \rho {\frac {\mathrm {D} \mathbf {u} }{\mathrm {D} t}}=\rho \left({\frac {\partial \mathbf {u} }{\partial t}}+(\mathbf {u} \cdot \nabla )\mathbf {u} \right)=-\nabla p+\nabla \cdot \left\{\mu \left[\nabla \mathbf {u} +(\nabla \mathbf {u} )^{\mathrm {T} }-{\tfrac {2}{3}}(\nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} )\mathbf {I} \right]\right\}+\rho \mathbf {f} .} If the dynamic μ and bulk ζ {\displaystyle \zeta } viscosities are assumed to be uniform in space, the equations in convective form can be simplified further. By computing the divergence of the stress tensor, since the divergence of tensor ∇ u {\textstyle \nabla \mathbf {u} } is ∇ 2 u {\textstyle \nabla ^{2}\mathbf {u} } and the divergence of tensor ( ∇ u ) T {\textstyle \left(\nabla \mathbf {u} \right)^{\mathrm {T} }} is ∇ ( ∇ ⋅ u ) {\textstyle \nabla \left(\nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} \right)} , one finally arrives to the compressible Navier–Stokes momentum equation: [14] Navier–Stokes momentum equation with uniform shear and bulk viscosities ( convective form ) D u D t = − 1 ρ ∇ p + ν ∇ 2 u + ( 1 3 ν + ξ ) ∇ ( ∇ ⋅ u ) + f . {\displaystyle {\frac {D\mathbf {u} }{Dt}}=-{\frac {1}{\rho }}\nabla p+\nu \,\nabla ^{2}\mathbf {u} +({\tfrac {1}{3}}\nu +\xi )\,\nabla (\nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} )+\mathbf {f} .} where D D t {\textstyle {\frac {\mathrm {D} }{\mathrm {D} t}}} is the material derivative . ν = μ ρ {\displaystyle \nu ={\frac {\mu }{\rho }}} is the shear kinematic viscosity and ξ = ζ ρ {\displaystyle \xi ={\frac {\zeta }{\rho }}} is the bulk kinematic viscosity. The left-hand side changes in the conservation form of the Navier–Stokes momentum equation. By bringing the operator on the flow velocity on the left side, on also has: Navier–Stokes momentum equation with uniform shear and bulk viscosities ( convective form ) ( ∂ ∂ t + u ⋅ ∇ − ν ∇ 2 − ( 1 3 ν + ξ ) ∇ ( ∇ ⋅ ) ) u = − 1 ρ ∇ p + f . {\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}+\mathbf {u} \cdot \nabla -\nu \,\nabla ^{2}-({\tfrac {1}{3}}\nu +\xi )\,\nabla (\nabla \cdot )\right)\mathbf {u} =-{\frac {1}{\rho }}\nabla p+\mathbf {f} .} The convective acceleration term can also be written as u ⋅ ∇ u = ( ∇ × u ) × u + 1 2 ∇ u 2 , {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf {u} =(\nabla \times \mathbf {u} )\times \mathbf {u} +{\tfrac {1}{2}}\nabla \mathbf {u} ^{2},} where the vector ( ∇ × u ) × u {\textstyle (\nabla \times \mathbf {u} )\times \mathbf {u} } is known as the Lamb vector . For the special case of an incompressible flow , the pressure constrains the flow so that the volume of fluid elements is constant: isochoric flow resulting in a solenoidal velocity field with ∇ ⋅ u = 0 {\textstyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} =0} . [15] Incompressible flow [ edit ] The incompressible momentum Navier–Stokes equation results from the following assumptions on the Cauchy stress tensor: [5] the stress is Galilean invariant : it does not depend directly on the flow velocity, but only on spatial derivatives of the flow velocity. So the stress variable is the tensor gradient ∇ u {\textstyle \nabla \mathbf {u} } . the fluid is assumed to be isotropic , as with gases and simple liquids, and consequently τ {\textstyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}} is an isotropic tensor; furthermore, since the deviatoric stress tensor can be expressed in terms of the dynamic viscosity μ {\textstyle \mu } : Stokes' stress constitutive equation (expression used for incompressible elastic solids) τ = 2 μ ε {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}=2\mu {\boldsymbol {\varepsilon }}} where ε = 1 2 ( ∇ u + ∇ u T ) {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\varepsilon }}={\tfrac {1}{2}}\left(\mathbf {\nabla u} +\mathbf {\nabla u} ^{\mathrm {T} }\right)} is the rate-of- strain tensor . So this decomposition can be made explicit as: [5] Stokes's stress constitutive equation (expression used for incompressible viscous fluids) τ = μ [ ∇ u + ( ∇ u ) T ] {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}=\mu \left[\nabla \mathbf {u} +(\nabla \mathbf {u} )^{\mathrm {T} }\right]} This is constitutive equation is also called the Newtonian law of viscosity . Dynamic viscosity μ need not be constant – in incompressible flows it can depend on density and on pressure. Any equation that makes explicit one of these transport coefficient in the conservative variables is called an equation of state . [8] The divergence of the deviatoric stress in case of uniform viscosity is given by: ∇ ⋅ τ = 2 μ ∇ ⋅ ε = μ ∇ ⋅ ( ∇ u + ∇ u T ) = μ ∇ 2 u {\displaystyle \nabla \cdot {\boldsymbol {\tau }}=2\mu \nabla \cdot {\boldsymbol {\varepsilon }}=\mu \nabla \cdot \left(\nabla \mathbf {u} +\nabla \mathbf {u} ^{\mathrm {T} }\right)=\mu \,\nabla ^{2}\mathbf {u} } because ∇ ⋅ u = 0 {\textstyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} =0} for an incompressible fluid. Incompressibility rules out density and pressure waves like sound or shock waves , so this simplification is not useful if these phenomena are of interest. The incompressible flow assumption typically holds well with all fluids at low Mach numbers (say up to about Mach 0.3), such as for modelling air winds at normal temperatures. [16] the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations are best visualized by dividing for the density: [17] Incompressible Navier–Stokes equations with uniform viscosity ( convective form ) D u D t = ∂ u ∂ t + ( u ⋅ ∇ ) u = ν ∇ 2 u − 1 ρ ∇ p + f . {\displaystyle {\frac {D\mathbf {u} }{Dt}}={\frac {\partial \mathbf {u} }{\partial t}}+(\mathbf {u} \cdot \nabla )\mathbf {u} =\nu \,\nabla ^{2}\mathbf {u} -{\frac {1}{\rho }}\nabla p+\mathbf {f} .} where ν = μ ρ {\textstyle \nu ={\frac {\mu }{\rho }}} is called the kinematic viscosity . By isolating the fluid velocity, one can also state: Incompressible Navier–Stokes equations with constant viscosity ( alternative convective form ) ( ∂ ∂ t + u ⋅ ∇ − ν ∇ 2 ) u = − 1 ρ ∇ p + f . {\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}+\mathbf {u} \cdot \nabla -\nu \,\nabla ^{2}\right)\mathbf {u} =-{\frac {1}{\rho }}\nabla p+\mathbf {f} .} If the density is constant throughout the fluid domain, or, in other words, if all fluid elements have the same density, ρ {\textstyle \rho } , then we have Incompressible Navier–Stokes equations with constant density and viscosity ( convective form ) D u D t = ν ∇ 2 u − ∇ p ρ + f , {\displaystyle {\frac {D\mathbf {u} }{Dt}}=\nu \,\nabla ^{2}\mathbf {u} -\nabla {\frac {p}{\rho }}+\mathbf {f} ,} where p / ρ {\textstyle p/\rho } is called the unit pressure head . In incompressible flows, the pressure field satisfies the Poisson equation , [9] ∇ 2 p = − ρ ∂ u i ∂ x k ∂ u k ∂ x i = − ρ ∂ 2 u i u k ∂ x k x i , {\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}p=-\rho {\frac {\partial u_{i}}{\partial x_{k}}}{\frac {\partial u_{k}}{\partial x_{i}}}=-\rho {\frac {\partial ^{2}u_{i}u_{k}}{\partial x_{k}x_{i}}},} which is obtained by taking the divergence of the momentum equations. A laminar flow example Velocity profile (laminar flow): u x = u ( y ) , u y = 0 , u z = 0 {\displaystyle u_{x}=u(y),\quad u_{y}=0,\quad u_{z}=0} for the x -direction, simplify the Navier–Stokes equation: 0 = − d P d x + μ ( d 2 u d y 2 ) {\displaystyle 0=-{\frac {\mathrm {d} P}{\mathrm {d} x}}+\mu \left({\frac {\mathrm {d} ^{2}u}{\mathrm {d} y^{2}}}\right)} Integrate twice to find the velocity profile with boundary conditions y = h , u = 0 , y = − h , u = 0 : u = 1 2 μ d P d x y 2 + A y + B {\displaystyle u={\frac {1}{2\mu }}{\frac {\mathrm {d} P}{\mathrm {d} x}}y^{2}+Ay+B} From this equation, substitute in the two boundary conditions to get two equations: 0 = 1 2 μ d P d x h 2 + A h + B 0 = 1 2 μ d P d x h 2 − A h + B {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}0&={\frac {1}{2\mu }}{\frac {\mathrm {d} P}{\mathrm {d} x}}h^{2}+Ah+B\\0&={\frac {1}{2\mu }}{\frac {\mathrm {d} P}{\mathrm {d} x}}h^{2}-Ah+B\end{aligned}}} Add and solve for B : B = − 1 2 μ d P d x h 2 {\displaystyle B=-{\frac {1}{2\mu }}{\frac {\mathrm {d} P}{\mathrm {d} x}}h^{2}} Substitute and solve for A : A = 0 {\displaystyle A=0} Finally this gives the velocity profile: u = 1 2 μ d P d x ( y 2 − h 2 ) {\displaystyle u={\frac {1}{2\mu }}{\frac {\mathrm {d} P}{\mathrm {d} x}}\left(y^{2}-h^{2}\right)} It is well worth observing the meaning of each term (compare to the Cauchy momentum equation ): ∂ u ∂ t ⏟ Variation + ( u ⋅ ∇ ) u ⏟ Divergence ⏞ Inertia (per volume) = ∂ ∂ − ∇ w ⏟ Internal source + ν ∇ 2 u ⏟ Diffusion ⏞ Divergence of stress + g ⏟ External source . {\displaystyle \overbrace {{\vphantom {\frac {}{}}}\underbrace {\frac {\partial \mathbf {u} }{\partial t}} _{\text{Variation}}+\underbrace {{\vphantom {\frac {}{}}}(\mathbf {u} \cdot \nabla )\mathbf {u} } _{\text{Divergence}}} ^{\text{Inertia (per volume)}}=\overbrace {{\vphantom {\frac {\partial }{\partial }}}\underbrace {{\vphantom {\frac {}{}}}-\nabla w} _{\begin{smallmatrix}{\text{Internal}}\\{\text{source}}\end{smallmatrix}}+\underbrace {{\vphantom {\frac {}{}}}\nu \nabla ^{2}\mathbf {u} } _{\text{Diffusion}}} ^{\text{Divergence of stress}}+\underbrace {{\vphantom {\frac {}{}}}\mathbf {g} } _{\begin{smallmatrix}{\text{External}}\\{\text{source}}\end{smallmatrix}}.} The higher-order term, namely the shear stress divergence ∇ ⋅ τ {\textstyle \nabla \cdot {\boldsymbol {\tau }}} , has simply reduced to the vector Laplacian term μ ∇ 2 u {\textstyle \mu \nabla ^{2}\mathbf {u} } . [18] This Laplacian term can be interpreted as the difference between the velocity at a point and the mean velocity in a small surrounding volume. This implies that – for a Newtonian fluid – viscosity operates as a diffusion of momentum , in much the same way as the heat conduction . In fact neglecting the convection term, incompressible Navier–Stokes equations lead to a vector diffusion equation (namely Stokes equations ), but in general the convection term is present, so incompressible Navier–Stokes equations belong to the class of convection–diffusion equations . In the usual case of an external field being a conservative field : g = − ∇ φ {\displaystyle \mathbf {g} =-\nabla \varphi } by defining the hydraulic head : h ≡ w + φ {\displaystyle h\equiv w+\varphi } one can finally condense the whole source in one term, arriving to the incompressible Navier–Stokes equation with conservative external field: ∂ u ∂ t + ( u ⋅ ∇ ) u − ν ∇ 2 u = − ∇ h . {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \mathbf {u} }{\partial t}}+(\mathbf {u} \cdot \nabla )\mathbf {u} -\nu \,\nabla ^{2}\mathbf {u} =-\nabla h.} The incompressible Navier–Stokes equations with uniform density and viscosity and conservative external field is the fundamental equation of hydraulics . The domain for these equations is commonly a 3 or less dimensional Euclidean space , for which an orthogonal coordinate reference frame is usually set to explicit the system of scalar partial differential equations to be solved. In 3-dimensional orthogonal coordinate systems are 3: Cartesian , cylindrical , and spherical . Expressing the Navier–Stokes vector equation in Cartesian coordinates is quite straightforward and not much influenced by the number of dimensions of the euclidean space employed, and this is the case also for the first-order terms (like the variation and convection ones) also in non-cartesian orthogonal coordinate systems. But for the higher order terms (the two coming from the divergence of the deviatoric stress that distinguish Navier–Stokes equations from Euler equations) some tensor calculus is required for deducing an expression in non-cartesian orthogonal coordinate systems. A special case of the fundamental equation of hydraulics is the Bernoulli's equation . The incompressible Navier–Stokes equation is composite, the sum of two orthogonal equations, ∂ u ∂ t = Π S ( − ( u ⋅ ∇ ) u + ν ∇ 2 u ) + f S ρ − 1 ∇ p = Π I ( − ( u ⋅ ∇ ) u + ν ∇ 2 u ) + f I {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\partial \mathbf {u} }{\partial t}}&=\Pi ^{S}\left(-(\mathbf {u} \cdot \nabla )\mathbf {u} +\nu \,\nabla ^{2}\mathbf {u} \right)+\mathbf {f} ^{S}\\\rho ^{-1}\,\nabla p&=\Pi ^{I}\left(-(\mathbf {u} \cdot \nabla )\mathbf {u} +\nu \,\nabla ^{2}\mathbf {u} \right)+\mathbf {f} ^{I}\end{aligned}}} where Π S {\textstyle \Pi ^{S}} and Π I {\textstyle \Pi ^{I}} are solenoidal and irrotational projection operators satisfying Π S + Π I = 1 {\textstyle \Pi ^{S}+\Pi ^{I}=1} , and f S {\textstyle \mathbf {f} ^{S}} and f I {\textstyle \mathbf {f} ^{I}} are the non-conservative and conservative parts of the body force. This result follows from the Helmholtz theorem (also known as the fundamental theorem of vector calculus). The first equation is a pressureless governing equation for the velocity, while the second equation for the pressure is a functional of the velocity and is related to the pressure Poisson equation. The explicit functional form of the projection operator in 3D is found from the Helmholtz Theorem: Π S F ( r ) = 1 4 π ∇ × ∫ ∇ ′ × F ( r ′ ) | r − r ′ | d V ′ , Π I = 1 − Π S {\displaystyle \Pi ^{S}\,\mathbf {F} (\mathbf {r} )={\frac {1}{4\pi }}\nabla \times \int {\frac {\nabla ^{\prime }\times \mathbf {F} (\mathbf {r} ')}{|\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {r} '|}}\,\mathrm {d} V',\quad \Pi ^{I}=1-\Pi ^{S}} with a similar structure in 2D. Thus the governing equation is an integro-differential equation similar to Coulomb and Biot–Savart law , not convenient for numerical computation. An equivalent weak or variational form of the equation, proved to produce the same velocity solution as the Navier–Stokes equation, [19] is given by, ( w , ∂ u ∂ t ) = − ( w , ( u ⋅ ∇ ) u ) − ν ( ∇ w : ∇ u ) + ( w , f S ) {\displaystyle \left(\mathbf {w} ,{\frac {\partial \mathbf {u} }{\partial t}}\right)=-{\bigl (}\mathbf {w} ,\left(\mathbf {u} \cdot \nabla \right)\mathbf {u} {\bigr )}-\nu \left(\nabla \mathbf {w} :\nabla \mathbf {u} \right)+\left(\mathbf {w} ,\mathbf {f} ^{S}\right)} for divergence-free test functions w {\textstyle \mathbf {w} } satisfying appropriate boundary conditions. Here, the projections are accomplished by the orthogonality of the solenoidal and irrotational function spaces. The discrete form of this is eminently suited to finite element computation of divergence-free flow, as we shall see in the next section. There one will be able to address the question ""How does one specify pressure-driven (Poiseuille) problems with a pressureless governing equation?"". The absence of pressure forces from the governing velocity equation demonstrates that the equation is not a dynamic one, but rather a kinematic equation where the divergence-free condition serves the role of a conservation equation. This all would seem to refute the frequent statements that the incompressible pressure enforces the divergence-free condition. Weak form of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations [ edit ] Strong form [ edit ] Consider the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations for a Newtonian fluid of constant density ρ {\textstyle \rho } in a domain Ω ⊂ R d ( d = 2 , 3 ) {\displaystyle \Omega \subset \mathbb {R} ^{d}\quad (d=2,3)} with boundary ∂ Ω = Γ D ∪ Γ N , {\displaystyle \partial \Omega =\Gamma _{D}\cup \Gamma _{N},} being Γ D {\textstyle \Gamma _{D}} and Γ N {\textstyle \Gamma _{N}} portions of the boundary where respectively a Dirichlet and a Neumann boundary condition is applied ( Γ D ∩ Γ N = ∅ {\textstyle \Gamma _{D}\cap \Gamma _{N}=\emptyset } ): [20] { ρ ∂ u ∂ t + ρ ( u ⋅ ∇ ) u − ∇ ⋅ σ ( u , p ) = f in Ω × ( 0 , T ) ∇ ⋅ u = 0 in Ω × ( 0 , T ) u = g on Γ D × ( 0 , T ) σ ( u , p ) n ^ = h on Γ N × ( 0 , T ) u ( 0 ) = u 0 in Ω × { 0 } {\displaystyle {\begin{cases}\rho {\dfrac {\partial \mathbf {u} }{\partial t}}+\rho (\mathbf {u} \cdot \nabla )\mathbf {u} -\nabla \cdot {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}(\mathbf {u} ,p)=\mathbf {f} &{\text{ in }}\Omega \times (0,T)\\\nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} =0&{\text{ in }}\Omega \times (0,T)\\\mathbf {u} =\mathbf {g} &{\text{ on }}\Gamma _{D}\times (0,T)\\{\boldsymbol {\sigma }}(\mathbf {u} ,p){\hat {\mathbf {n} }}=\mathbf {h} &{\text{ on }}\Gamma _{N}\times (0,T)\\\mathbf {u} (0)=\mathbf {u} _{0}&{\text{ in }}\Omega \times \{0\}\end{cases}}} u {\textstyle \mathbf {u} } is the fluid velocity, p {\textstyle p} the fluid pressure, f {\textstyle \mathbf {f} } a given forcing term, n ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {\mathbf {n} }}} the outward directed unit normal vector to Γ N {\textstyle \Gamma _{N}} , and σ ( u , p ) {\textstyle {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}(\mathbf {u} ,p)} the viscous stress tensor defined as: [20] σ ( u , p ) = − p I + 2 μ ε ( u ) . {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}(\mathbf {u} ,p)=-p\mathbf {I} +2\mu {\boldsymbol {\varepsilon }}(\mathbf {u} ).} Let μ {\textstyle \mu } be the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, I {\textstyle \mathbf {I} } the second-order identity tensor and ε ( u ) {\textstyle {\boldsymbol {\varepsilon }}(\mathbf {u} )} the strain-rate tensor defined as: [20] ε ( u ) = 1 2 ( ( ∇ u ) + ( ∇ u ) T ) . {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\varepsilon }}(\mathbf {u} )={\frac {1}{2}}\left(\left(\nabla \mathbf {u} \right)+\left(\nabla \mathbf {u} \right)^{\mathrm {T} }\right).} The functions g {\textstyle \mathbf {g} } and h {\textstyle \mathbf {h} } are given Dirichlet and Neumann boundary data, while u 0 {\textstyle \mathbf {u} _{0}} is the initial condition .

\,\Delta \mathbf {u} .\end{aligned}}} Moreover, note that the Neumann boundary conditions can be rearranged as: [20] σ ( u , p ) n ^ = ( − p I + 2 μ ε ( u ) ) n ^ = − p n ^ + μ ∂ u ∂ n ^ . {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}(\mathbf {u} ,p){\hat {\mathbf {n} }}=\left(-p\mathbf {I} +2\mu {\boldsymbol {\varepsilon }}(\mathbf {u} )\right){\hat {\mathbf {n} }}=-p{\hat {\mathbf {n} }}+\mu {\frac {\partial {\boldsymbol {u}}}{\partial {\hat {\mathbf {n} }}}}.} Weak form [ edit ] In order to find the weak form of the Navier–Stokes equations, firstly, consider the momentum equation [20] ρ ∂ u ∂ t − μ Δ u + ρ ( u ⋅ ∇ ) u + ∇ p = f {\displaystyle \rho {\frac {\partial \mathbf {u} }{\partial t}}-\mu \Delta \mathbf {u} +\rho (\mathbf {u} \cdot \nabla )\mathbf {u} +\nabla p=\mathbf {f} } multiply it for a test function v {\textstyle \mathbf {v} } , defined in a suitable space V {\textstyle V} , and integrate both members with respect to the domain Ω {\textstyle \Omega } : [20] ∫ Ω ρ ∂ u ∂ t ⋅ v − ∫ Ω μ Δ u ⋅ v + ∫ Ω ρ ( u ⋅ ∇ ) u ⋅ v + ∫ Ω ∇ p ⋅ v = ∫ Ω f ⋅ v {\displaystyle \int \limits _{\Omega }\rho {\frac {\partial \mathbf {u} }{\partial t}}\cdot \mathbf {v} -\int \limits _{\Omega }\mu \Delta \mathbf {u} \cdot \mathbf {v} +\int \limits _{\Omega }\rho (\mathbf {u} \cdot \nabla )\mathbf {u} \cdot \mathbf {v} +\int \limits _{\Omega }\nabla p\cdot \mathbf {v} =\int \limits _{\Omega }\mathbf {f} \cdot \mathbf {v} } Counter-integrating by parts the diffusive and the pressure terms and by using the Gauss' theorem: [20] − ∫ Ω μ Δ u ⋅ v = ∫ Ω μ ∇ u ⋅ ∇ v − ∫ ∂ Ω μ ∂ u ∂ n ^ ⋅ v ∫ Ω ∇ p ⋅ v = − ∫ Ω p ∇ ⋅ v + ∫ ∂ Ω p v ⋅ n ^ {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}-\int \limits _{\Omega }\mu \Delta \mathbf {u} \cdot \mathbf {v} &=\int _{\Omega }\mu \nabla \mathbf {u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf {v} -\int \limits _{\partial \Omega }\mu {\frac {\partial \mathbf {u} }{\partial {\hat {\mathbf {n} }}}}\cdot \mathbf {v} \\\int \limits _{\Omega }\nabla p\cdot \mathbf {v} &=-\int \limits _{\Omega }p\nabla \cdot \mathbf {v} +\int \limits _{\partial \Omega }p\mathbf {v} \cdot {\hat {\mathbf {n} }}\end{aligned}}} Using these relations, one gets: [20] ∫ Ω ρ ∂ u ∂ t ⋅ v + ∫ Ω μ ∇ u ⋅ ∇ v + ∫ Ω ρ ( u ⋅ ∇ ) u ⋅ v − ∫ Ω p ∇ ⋅ v = ∫ Ω f ⋅ v + ∫ ∂ Ω ( μ ∂ u ∂ n ^ − p n ^ ) ⋅ v ∀ v ∈ V . {\displaystyle \int \limits _{\Omega }\rho {\dfrac {\partial \mathbf {u} }{\partial t}}\cdot \mathbf {v} +\int \limits _{\Omega }\mu \nabla \mathbf {u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf {v} +\int \limits _{\Omega }\rho (\mathbf {u} \cdot \nabla )\mathbf {u} \cdot \mathbf {v} -\int \limits _{\Omega }p\nabla \cdot \mathbf {v} =\int \limits _{\Omega }\mathbf {f} \cdot \mathbf {v} +\int \limits _{\partial \Omega }\left(\mu {\frac {\partial \mathbf {u} }{\partial {\hat {\mathbf {n} }}}}-p{\hat {\mathbf {n} }}\right)\cdot \mathbf {v} \quad \forall \mathbf {v} \in V.} In the same fashion, the continuity equation is multiplied for a test function q belonging to a space Q {\textstyle Q} and integrated in the domain Ω {\textstyle \Omega } : [20] ∫ Ω q ∇ ⋅ u = 0. ∀ q ∈ Q . {\displaystyle \int \limits _{\Omega }q\nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} =0.\quad \forall q\in Q.} The space functions are chosen as follows: V = [ H 0 1 ( Ω ) ] d = { v ∈ [ H 1 ( Ω ) ] d : v = 0 on Γ D } , Q = L 2 ( Ω ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}V=\left[H_{0}^{1}(\Omega )\right]^{d}&=\left\{\mathbf {v} \in \left[H^{1}(\Omega )\right]^{d}:\quad \mathbf {v} =\mathbf {0} {\text{ on }}\Gamma _{D}\right\},\\Q&=L^{2}(\Omega )\end{aligned}}} Considering that the test function v vanishes on the Dirichlet boundary and considering the Neumann condition, the integral on the boundary can be rearranged as: [20] ∫ ∂ Ω ( μ ∂ u ∂ n ^ − p n ^ ) ⋅ v = ∫ Γ D ( μ ∂ u ∂ n ^ − p n ^ ) ⋅ v ⏟ v = 0 on Γ D + ∫ Γ N ∫ Γ N ( μ ∂ u ∂ n ^ − p n ^ ) ⏟ = h on Γ N ⋅ v = ∫ Γ N h ⋅ v . {\displaystyle \int \limits _{\partial \Omega }\left(\mu {\frac {\partial \mathbf {u} }{\partial {\hat {\mathbf {n} }}}}-p{\hat {\mathbf {n} }}\right)\cdot \mathbf {v} =\underbrace {\int \limits _{\Gamma _{D}}\left(\mu {\frac {\partial \mathbf {u} }{\partial {\hat {\mathbf {n} }}}}-p{\hat {\mathbf {n} }}\right)\cdot \mathbf {v} } _{\mathbf {v} =\mathbf {0} {\text{ on }}\Gamma _{D}\ }+\int \limits _{\Gamma _{N}}\underbrace {{\vphantom {\int \limits _{\Gamma _{N}}}}\left(\mu {\frac {\partial \mathbf {u} }{\partial {\hat {\mathbf {n} }}}}-p{\hat {\mathbf {n} }}\right)} _{=\mathbf {h} {\text{ on }}\Gamma _{N}}\cdot \mathbf {v} =\int \limits _{\Gamma _{N}}\mathbf {h} \cdot \mathbf {v} .} Having this in mind, the weak formulation of the Navier–Stokes equations is expressed as: [20] find u ∈ L 2 ( R + [ H 1 ( Ω ) ] d ) ∩ C 0 ( R + [ L 2 ( Ω ) ] d ) such that: { ∫ Ω ρ ∂ u ∂ t ⋅ v + ∫ Ω μ ∇ u ⋅ ∇ v + ∫ Ω ρ ( u ⋅ ∇ ) u ⋅ v − ∫ Ω p ∇ ⋅ v = ∫ Ω f ⋅ v + ∫ Γ N h ⋅ v ∀ v ∈ V , ∫ Ω q ∇ ⋅ u = 0 ∀ q ∈ Q . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&{\text{find }}\mathbf {u} \in L^{2}\left(\mathbb {R} ^{+}\;\left[H^{1}(\Omega )\right]^{d}\right)\cap C^{0}\left(\mathbb

}q\nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} =0\quad \forall q\in Q.\end{cases}}\end{aligned}}} Discrete velocity [ edit ] With partitioning of the problem domain and defining basis functions on the partitioned domain, the discrete form of the governing equation is ( w i , ∂ u j ∂ t ) = − ( w i , ( u ⋅ ∇ ) u j ) − ν ( ∇ w i : ∇ u j ) + ( w i , f S ) . {\displaystyle \left(\mathbf {w} _{i},{\frac {\partial \mathbf {u} _{j}}{\partial t}}\right)=-{\bigl (}\mathbf {w} _{i},\left(\mathbf {u} \cdot \nabla \right)\mathbf {u} _{j}{\bigr )}-\nu \left(\nabla \mathbf {w} _{i}:\nabla \mathbf {u} _{j}\right)+\left(\mathbf {w} _{i},\mathbf {f} ^{S}\right).} It is desirable to choose basis functions that reflect the essential feature of incompressible flow – the elements must be divergence-free. While the velocity is the variable of interest, the existence of the stream function or vector potential is necessary by the Helmholtz theorem. Further, to determine fluid flow in the absence of a pressure gradient, one can specify the difference of stream function values across a 2D channel, or the line integral of the tangential component of the vector potential around the channel in 3D, the flow being given by Stokes' theorem . Discussion will be restricted to 2D in the following. We further restrict discussion to continuous Hermite finite elements which have at least first-derivative degrees-of-freedom. With this, one can draw a large number of candidate triangular and rectangular elements from the plate-bending literature. These elements have derivatives as components of the gradient. In 2D, the gradient and curl of a scalar are clearly orthogonal, given by the expressions, ∇ φ = ( ∂ φ ∂ x , ∂ φ ∂ y ) T , ∇ × φ = ( ∂ φ ∂ y , − ∂ φ ∂ x ) T . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\nabla \varphi &=\left({\frac {\partial \varphi }{\partial x}},\,{\frac {\partial \varphi }{\partial y}}\right)^{\mathrm {T} },\\[5pt]\nabla \times \varphi &=\left({\frac {\partial \varphi }{\partial y}},\,-{\frac {\partial \varphi }{\partial x}}\right)^{\mathrm {T} }.\end{aligned}}} Adopting continuous plate-bending elements, interchanging the derivative degrees-of-freedom and changing the sign of the appropriate one gives many families of stream function elements. Taking the curl of the scalar stream function elements gives divergence-free velocity elements. [21] [22] The requirement that the stream function elements be continuous assures that the normal component of the velocity is continuous across element interfaces, all that is necessary for vanishing divergence on these interfaces. Boundary conditions are simple to apply. The stream function is constant on no-flow surfaces, with no-slip velocity conditions on surfaces. Stream function differences across open channels determine the flow. No boundary conditions are necessary on open boundaries, though consistent values may be used with some problems. These are all Dirichlet conditions. The algebraic equations to be solved are simple to set up, but of course are non-linear , requiring iteration of the linearized equations. Similar considerations apply to three-dimensions, but extension from 2D is not immediate because of the vector nature of the potential, and there exists no simple relation between the gradient and the curl as was the case in 2D. Pressure recovery [ edit ] Recovering pressure from the velocity field is easy. The discrete weak equation for the pressure gradient is, ( g i , ∇ p ) = − ( g i , ( u ⋅ ∇ ) u j ) − ν ( ∇ g i : ∇ u j ) + ( g i , f I ) {\displaystyle (\mathbf {g} _{i},\nabla p)=-\left(\mathbf {g} _{i},\left(\mathbf {u} \cdot \nabla \right)\mathbf {u} _{j}\right)-\nu \left(\nabla \mathbf {g} _{i}:\nabla \mathbf {u} _{j}\right)+\left(\mathbf {g} _{i},\mathbf {f} ^{I}\right)} where the test/weight functions are irrotational. Any conforming scalar finite element may be used. However, the pressure gradient field may also be of interest. In this case, one can use scalar Hermite elements for the pressure. For the test/weight functions g i {\textstyle \mathbf {g} _{i}} one would choose the irrotational vector elements obtained from the gradient of the pressure element. Non-inertial frame of reference [ edit ] The rotating frame of reference introduces some interesting pseudo-forces into the equations through the material derivative term. Consider a stationary inertial frame of reference K {\textstyle K} , and a non-inertial frame of reference K ′ {\textstyle K'} , which is translating with velocity U ( t ) {\textstyle \mathbf {U} (t)} and rotating with angular velocity Ω ( t ) {\textstyle \Omega (t)} with respect to the stationary frame. The Navier–Stokes equation observed from the non-inertial frame then becomes Navier–Stokes momentum equation in non-inertial frame ρ ( ∂ u ∂ t + ( u ⋅ ∇ ) u ) = − ∇ p + ∇ ⋅ { μ [ ∇ u + ( ∇ u ) T − 2 3 ( ∇ ⋅ u ) I ] } + ∇ [ ζ ( ∇ ⋅ u ) ] + ρ f − ρ [ 2 Ω × u + Ω × ( Ω × x ) + d U d t + d Ω d t × x ] . {\displaystyle \rho \left({\frac {\partial \mathbf {u} }{\partial t}}+(\mathbf {u} \cdot \nabla )\mathbf {u} \right)=-\nabla p+\nabla \cdot \left\{\mu \left[\nabla \mathbf {u} +(\nabla \mathbf {u} )^{\mathrm {T} }-{\tfrac {2}{3}}(\nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} )\mathbf {I} \right]\right\}+\nabla [\zeta (\nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} )]+\rho \mathbf {f} -\rho \left[2\mathbf {\Omega } \times \mathbf {u} +\mathbf {\Omega } \times (\mathbf {\Omega } \times \mathbf {x} )+{\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {U} }{\mathrm {d} t}}+{\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {\Omega } }{\mathrm {d} t}}\times \mathbf {x} \right].} Here x {\textstyle \mathbf {x} } and u {\textstyle \mathbf {u} } are measured in the non-inertial frame. The first term in the parenthesis represents Coriolis acceleration , the second term is due to centrifugal acceleration , the third is due to the linear acceleration of K ′ {\textstyle K'} with respect to K {\textstyle K} and the fourth term is due to the angular acceleration of K ′ {\textstyle K'} with respect to K {\textstyle K} . Other equations [ edit ] The Navier–Stokes equations are strictly a statement of the balance of momentum. To fully describe fluid flow, more information is needed, how much depending on the assumptions made. This additional information may include boundary data ( no-slip , capillary surface , etc.), conservation of mass, balance of energy , and/or an equation of state . Continuity equation for incompressible fluid [ edit ] Main article: Continuity equation Regardless of the flow assumptions, a statement of the conservation of mass is generally necessary. This is achieved through the mass continuity equation , as discussed above in the ""General continuum equations"" within this article, as follows: D m D t = ∭ V ( D ρ D t + ρ ( ∇ ⋅ u ) ) d V D ρ D t + ρ ( ∇ ⋅ u ) = ∂ ρ ∂ t + ( ∇ ρ ) ⋅ u + ρ ( ∇ ⋅ u ) = ∂ ρ ∂ t + ∇ ⋅ ( ρ u ) = 0 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\mathbf {D} m}{\mathbf {Dt} }}&={\iiint \limits _{V}}({{\frac {\mathbf {D} \rho }{\mathbf {Dt} }}+\rho (\nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} )})dV\\{\frac {\mathbf {D} \rho }{\mathbf {Dt} }}+\rho (\nabla \cdot {\mathbf {u} })&={\frac {\partial \rho }{\partial t}}+({\nabla \rho })\cdot {\mathbf {u} }+{\rho }(\nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} )={\frac {\partial \rho }{\partial t}}+\nabla \cdot ({\rho \mathbf {u} })=0\end{aligned}}} A fluid media for which the density ( ρ {\displaystyle \rho } ) is constant is called incompressible . Therefore, the rate of change of density ( ρ {\displaystyle \rho } ) with respect to time ( ∂ ρ ∂ t ) {\displaystyle ({\frac {\partial \rho }{\partial t}})} and the gradient of density ( ∇ ρ ) {\displaystyle (\nabla \rho )} are equal to zero ( 0 ) {\displaystyle (0)} . In this case the general equation of continuity, ∂ ρ ∂ t + ∇ ( ρ u ) = 0 {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \rho }{\partial t}}+\nabla ({\rho \mathbf {u} })=0} , reduces to: ρ ( ∇ ⋅ u ) = 0 {\displaystyle \rho (\nabla {\cdot }{\mathbf {u} })=0} . Furthermore, assuming that density ( ρ {\displaystyle \rho } ) is a non-zero constant ( ρ ≠ 0 ) {\displaystyle (\rho \neq 0)} means that the right-hand side of the equation ( 0 ) {\displaystyle (0)} is divisible by density ( ρ {\displaystyle \rho } ). Therefore, the continuity equation for an incompressible fluid reduces further to: ( ∇ ⋅ u ) = 0 {\displaystyle (\nabla {\cdot {\mathbf {u} }})=0} This relationship, ( ∇ ⋅ u ) = 0 {\textstyle (\nabla {\cdot {\mathbf {u} }})=0} , identifies that the divergence of the flow velocity vector ( u {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} } ) is equal to zero ( 0 ) {\displaystyle (0)} , which means that for an incompressible fluid the flow velocity field is a solenoidal vector field or a divergence-free vector field . Note that this relationship can be expanded upon due to its uniqueness with the vector Laplace operator ( ∇ 2 u = ∇ ( ∇ ⋅ u ) − ∇ × ( ∇ × u ) ) {\displaystyle (\nabla ^{2}\mathbf {u} =\nabla (\nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} )-\nabla \times (\nabla \times \mathbf {u} ))} , and vorticity ( ω → = ∇ × u ) {\displaystyle ({\vec {\omega }}=\nabla \times \mathbf {u} )} which is now expressed like so, for an incompressible fluid : ∇ 2 u = − ( ∇ × ( ∇ × u ) ) = − ( ∇ × ω → ) {\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}\mathbf {u} =-(\nabla \times (\nabla \times \mathbf {u} ))=-(\nabla \times {\vec {\omega }})} Stream function for incompressible 2D fluid [ edit ] Taking the curl of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equation results in the elimination of pressure. This is especially easy to see if 2D Cartesian flow is assumed (like in the degenerate 3D case with u z = 0 {\textstyle u_{z}=0} and no dependence of anything on z {\textstyle z} ), where the equations reduce to: ρ ( ∂ u x ∂ t + u x ∂ u x ∂ x + u y ∂ u x ∂ y ) = − ∂ p ∂ x + μ ( ∂ 2 u x ∂ x 2 + ∂ 2 u x ∂ y 2 ) + ρ g x ρ ( ∂ u y ∂ t + u x ∂ u y ∂ x + u y ∂ u y ∂ y ) = − ∂ p ∂ y + μ ( ∂ 2 u y ∂ x 2 + ∂ 2 u y ∂ y 2 ) + ρ g y . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\rho \left({\frac {\partial u_{x}}{\partial t}}+u_{x}{\frac {\partial u_{x}}{\partial x}}+u_{y}{\frac {\partial u_{x}}{\partial y}}\right)&=-{\frac {\partial p}{\partial x}}+\mu \left({\frac {\partial ^{2}u_{x}}{\partial x^{2}}}+{\frac {\partial ^{2}u_{x}}{\partial y^{2}}}\right)+\rho g_{x}\\\rho \left({\frac {\partial u_{y}}{\partial t}}+u_{x}{\frac {\partial u_{y}}{\partial x}}+u_{y}{\frac {\partial u_{y}}{\partial y}}\right)&=-{\frac {\partial p}{\partial y}}+\mu \left({\frac {\partial ^{2}u_{y}}{\partial x^{2}}}+{\frac {\partial ^{2}u_{y}}{\partial y^{2}}}\right)+\rho g_{y}.\end{aligned}}} Differentiating the first with respect to y {\textstyle y} , the second with respect to x {\textstyle x} and subtracting the resulting equations will eliminate pressure and any conservative force . For incompressible flow, defining the stream function ψ {\textstyle \psi } through u x = ∂ ψ ∂ y ; u y = − ∂ ψ ∂ x {\displaystyle u_{x}={\frac {\partial \psi }{\partial y}};\quad u_{y}=-{\frac {\partial \psi }{\partial x}}} results in mass continuity being unconditionally satisfied (given the stream function is continuous), and then incompressible Newtonian 2D momentum and mass conservation condense into one equation: ∂ ∂ t ( ∇ 2 ψ ) + ∂ ψ ∂ y ∂ ∂ x ( ∇ 2 ψ ) − ∂ ψ ∂ x ∂ ∂ y ( ∇ 2 ψ ) = ν ∇ 4 ψ {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}\left(\nabla ^{2}\psi \right)+{\frac {\partial \psi }{\partial y}}{\frac {\partial }{\partial x}}\left(\nabla ^{2}\psi \right)-{\frac {\partial \psi }{\partial x}}{\frac {\partial }{\partial y}}\left(\nabla ^{2}\psi \right)=\nu \nabla ^{4}\psi } where ∇ 4 {\textstyle \nabla ^{4}} is the 2D biharmonic operator and ν {\textstyle \nu } is the kinematic viscosity , ν = μ p {\textstyle \nu ={\frac {\mu }{p}}} . We can also express this compactly using the Jacobian determinant : ∂ ∂ t ( ∇ 2 ψ ) + ∂ ( ψ , ∇ 2 ψ ) ∂ ( y , x ) = ν ∇ 4 ψ . {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}\left(\nabla ^{2}\psi \right)+{\frac {\partial \left(\psi ,\nabla ^{2}\psi \right)}{\partial (y,x)}}=\nu \nabla ^{4}\psi .} This single equation together with appropriate boundary conditions describes 2D fluid flow, taking only kinematic viscosity as a parameter. Note that the equation for creeping flow results when the left side is assumed zero. In axisymmetric flow another stream function formulation, called the Stokes stream function , can be used to describe the velocity components of an incompressible flow with one scalar function. The incompressible Navier–Stokes equation is a differential algebraic equation , having the inconvenient feature that there is no explicit mechanism for advancing the pressure in time. Consequently, much effort has been expended to eliminate the pressure from all or part of the computational process. The stream function formulation eliminates the pressure but only in two dimensions and at the expense of introducing higher derivatives and elimination of the velocity, which is the primary variable of interest. Properties [ edit ] Nonlinearity [ edit ] The Navier–Stokes equations are nonlinear partial differential equations in the general case and so remain in almost every real situation. [23] [24] In some cases, such as one-dimensional flow and Stokes flow (or creeping flow), the equations can be simplified to linear equations. The nonlinearity makes most problems difficult or impossible to solve and is the main contributor to the turbulence that the equations model. The nonlinearity is due to convective acceleration, which is an acceleration associated with the change in velocity over position. Hence, any convective flow, whether turbulent or not, will involve nonlinearity. An example of convective but laminar (nonturbulent) flow would be the passage of a viscous fluid (for example, oil) through a small converging nozzle . Such flows, whether exactly solvable or not, can often be thoroughly studied and understood. [25] Turbulence [ edit ] Turbulence is the time-dependent chaotic behaviour seen in many fluid flows. It is generally believed that it is due to the inertia of the fluid as a whole: the culmination of time-dependent and convective acceleration; hence flows where inertial effects are small tend to be laminar (the Reynolds number quantifies how much the flow is affected by inertia). It is believed, though not known with certainty, that the Navier–Stokes equations describe turbulence properly. [26] The numerical solution of the Navier–Stokes equations for turbulent flow is extremely difficult, and due to the significantly different mixing-length scales that are involved in turbulent flow, the stable solution of this requires such a fine mesh resolution that the computational time becomes significantly infeasible for calculation or direct numerical simulation . Attempts to solve turbulent flow using a laminar solver typically result in a time-unsteady solution, which fails to converge appropriately. To counter this, time-averaged equations such as the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations (RANS), supplemented with turbulence models, are used in practical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applications when modeling turbulent flows. Some models include the Spalart–Allmaras , k – ω , k – ε , and SST models, which add a variety of additional equations to bring closure to the RANS equations. Large eddy simulation (LES) can also be used to solve these equations numerically. This approach is computationally more expensive—in time and in computer memory—than RANS, but produces better results because it explicitly resolves the larger turbulent scales. Applicability [ edit ] Further information: Discretization of Navier–Stokes equations Together with supplemental equations (for example, conservation of mass) and well-formulated boundary conditions, the Navier–Stokes equations seem to model fluid motion accurately; even turbulent flows seem (on average) to agree with real world observations. The Navier–Stokes equations assume that the fluid being studied is a continuum (it is infinitely divisible and not composed of particles such as atoms or molecules), and is not moving at relativistic velocities . At very small scales or under extreme conditions, real fluids made out of discrete molecules will produce results different from the continuous fluids modeled by the Navier–Stokes equations. For example, capillarity of internal layers in fluids appears for flow with high gradients. [27] For large Knudsen number of the problem, the Boltzmann equation may be a suitable replacement. [28] Failing that, one may have to resort to molecular dynamics or various hybrid methods. [29] Another limitation is simply the complicated nature of the equations. Time-tested formulations exist for common fluid families, but the application of the Navier–Stokes equations to less common families tends to result in very complicated formulations and often to open research problems. For this reason, these equations are usually written for Newtonian fluids where the viscosity model is linear ; truly general models for the flow of other kinds of fluids (such as blood) do not exist. [30] Application to specific problems [ edit ] The Navier–Stokes equations, even when written explicitly for specific fluids, are rather generic in nature and their proper application to specific problems can be very diverse. This is partly because there is an enormous variety of problems that may be modeled, ranging from as simple as the distribution of static pressure to as complicated as multiphase flow driven by surface tension . Generally, application to specific problems begins with some flow assumptions and initial/boundary condition formulation, this may be followed by scale analysis to further simplify the problem. Visualization of (a) parallel flow and (b) radial flow. Parallel flow [ edit ] Assume steady, parallel, one-dimensional, non-convective pressure-driven flow between parallel plates, the resulting scaled (dimensionless) boundary value problem is: d 2 u d y 2 = − 1 ; u ( 0 ) = u ( 1 ) = 0. {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} ^{2}u}{\mathrm {d} y^{2}}}=-1;\quad u(0)=u(1)=0.} The boundary condition is the no slip condition . This problem is easily solved for the flow field: u ( y ) = y − y 2 2 . {\displaystyle u(y)={\frac {y-y^{2}}{2}}.} From this point onward, more quantities of interest can be easily obtained, such as viscous drag force or net flow rate. Radial flow [ edit ] Difficulties may arise when the problem becomes slightly more complicated. A seemingly modest twist on the parallel flow above would be the radial flow between parallel plates; this involves convection and thus non-linearity. The velocity field may be represented by a function f ( z ) that must satisfy: d 2 f d z 2 + R f 2 = − 1 ; f ( − 1 ) = f ( 1 ) = 0. {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} ^{2}f}{\mathrm {d} z^{2}}}+Rf^{2}=-1;\quad f(-1)=f(1)=0.} This ordinary differential equation is what is obtained when the Navier–Stokes equations are written and the flow assumptions applied (additionally, the pressure gradient is solved for). The nonlinear term makes this a very difficult problem to solve analytically (a lengthy implicit solution may be found which involves elliptic integrals and roots of cubic polynomials ). Issues with the actual existence of solutions arise for R > 1.41 {\textstyle R>1.41} (approximately; this is not √ 2 ), the parameter R {\textstyle R} being the Reynolds number with appropriately chosen scales. [31] This is an example of flow assumptions losing their applicability, and an example of the difficulty in ""high"" Reynolds number flows. [31] Convection [ edit ] A type of natural convection that can be described by the Navier–Stokes equation is the Rayleigh–Bénard convection . It is one of the most commonly studied convection phenomena because of its analytical and experimental accessibility. Exact solutions of the Navier–Stokes equations [ edit ] Some exact solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations exist. Examples of degenerate cases—with the non-linear terms in the Navier–Stokes equations equal to zero—are Poiseuille flow , Couette flow and the oscillatory Stokes boundary layer . But also, more interesting examples, solutions to the full non-linear equations, exist, such as Jeffery–Hamel flow , Von Kármán swirling flow , stagnation point flow , Landau–Squire jet , and Taylor–Green vortex . [32] [33] [34] Note that the existence of these exact solutions does not imply they are stable: turbulence may develop at higher Reynolds numbers. Under additional assumptions, the component parts can be separated. [35] A two-dimensional example For example, in the case of an unbounded planar domain with two-dimensional — incompressible and stationary — flow in polar coordinates ( r , φ ) , the velocity components ( u r , u φ ) and pressure p are: [36] u r = A r , u φ = B ( 1 r − r A ν + 1 ) , p = − A 2 + B 2 2 r 2 − 2 B 2 ν r A ν A + B 2 r ( 2 A ν + 2 ) 2 A ν + 2 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}u_{r}&={\frac {A}{r}},\\u_{\varphi }&=B\left({\frac {1}{r}}-r^{{\frac {A}{\nu }}+1}\right),\\p&=-{\frac {A^{2}+B^{2}}{2r^{2}}}-{\frac {2B^{2}\nu r^{\frac {A}{\nu }}}{A}}+{\frac {B^{2}r^{\left({\frac {2A}{\nu }}+2\right)}}{{\frac {2A}{\nu }}+2}}\end{aligned}}} where A and B are arbitrary constants. This solution is valid in the domain r ≥ 1 and for A < −2 ν . In Cartesian coordinates, when the viscosity is zero ( ν = 0 ), this is: v ( x , y ) = 1 x 2 + y 2 ( A x + B y A y − B x ) , p ( x , y ) = − A 2 + B 2 2 ( x 2 + y 2 ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbf {v} (x,y)&={\frac {1}{x^{2}+y^{2}}}{\begin{pmatrix}Ax+By\\Ay-Bx\end{pmatrix}},\\p(x,y)&=-{\frac {A^{2}+B^{2}}{2\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)}}\end{aligned}}} A three-dimensional example For example, in the case of an unbounded Euclidean domain with three-dimensional — incompressible, stationary and with zero viscosity ( ν = 0 ) — radial flow in Cartesian coordinates ( x , y , z ) , the velocity vector v and pressure p are: [ citation needed ] v ( x , y , z ) = A x 2 + y 2 + z 2 ( x y z ) , p ( x , y , z ) = − A 2 2 ( x 2 + y 2 + z 2 ) . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbf {v} (x,y,z)&={\frac {A}{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}}{\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\\z\end{pmatrix}},\\p(x,y,z)&=-{\frac {A^{2}}{2\left(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}\right)}}.\end{aligned}}} There is a singularity at x = y = z = 0 . A three-dimensional steady-state vortex solution [ edit ] Wire model of flow lines along a Hopf fibration . A steady-state example with no singularities comes from considering the flow along the lines of a Hopf fibration . Let r {\textstyle r} be a constant radius of the inner coil.

This is a solution in a non-viscous gas (compressible fluid) whose density, velocities and pressure goes to zero far from the origin. (Note this is not a solution to the Clay Millennium problem because that refers to incompressible fluids where ρ {\textstyle \rho } is a constant, and neither does it deal with the uniqueness of the Navier–Stokes equations with respect to any turbulence properties.) It is also worth pointing out that the components of the velocity vector are exactly those from the Pythagorean quadruple parametrization. Other choices of density and pressure are possible with the same velocity field: Other choices of density and pressure Another choice of pressure and density with the same velocity vector above is one where the pressure and density fall to zero at the origin and are highest in the central loop at z = 0 , x 2 + y 2 = r 2 : ρ ( x , y , z ) = 20 B ( x 2 + y 2 ) ( r 2 + x 2 + y 2 + z 2 ) 3 p ( x , y , z ) = − A 2 B ( r 2 + x 2 + y 2 + z 2 ) 4 + − 4 A 2 B ( x 2 + y 2 ) ( r 2 + x 2 + y 2 + z 2 ) 5 . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\rho (x,y,z)&={\frac {20B\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)}{\left(r^{2}+x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}\right)^{3}}}\\p(x,y,z)&={\frac {-A^{2}B}{\left(r^{2}+x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}\right)^{4}}}+{\frac {-4A^{2}B\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)}{\left(r^{2}+x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}\right)^{5}}}.\end{aligned}}} In fact in general there are simple solutions for any polynomial function f where the density is: ρ ( x , y , z ) = 1 r 2 + x 2 + y 2 + z 2 f ( x 2 + y 2 ( r 2 + x 2 + y 2 + z 2 ) 2 ) . {\displaystyle \rho (x,y,z)={\frac {1}{r^{2}+x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}}f\left({\frac {x^{2}+y^{2}}{\left(r^{2}+x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}\right)^{2}}}\right).} Viscous three-dimensional periodic solutions [ edit ] Two examples of periodic fully-three-dimensional viscous solutions are described in. [38] These solutions are defined on a three-dimensional torus T 3 = [ 0 , L ] 3 {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} ^{3}=[0,L]^{3}} and are characterized by positive and negative helicity respectively. The solution with positive helicity is given by: u x = 4 2 3 3 U 0 [ sin ⁡ ( k x − π / 3 ) cos ⁡ ( k y + π / 3 ) sin ⁡ ( k z + π / 2 ) − cos ⁡ ( k z − π / 3 ) sin ⁡ ( k x + π / 3 ) sin ⁡ ( k y + π / 2 ) ] e − 3 ν k 2 t u y = 4 2 3 3 U 0 [ sin ⁡ ( k y − π / 3 ) cos ⁡ ( k z + π / 3 ) sin ⁡ ( k x + π / 2 ) − cos ⁡ ( k x − π / 3 ) sin ⁡ ( k y + π / 3 ) sin ⁡ ( k z + π / 2 ) ] e − 3 ν k 2 t u z = 4 2 3 3 U 0 [ sin ⁡ ( k z − π / 3 ) cos ⁡ ( k x + π / 3 ) sin ⁡ ( k y + π / 2 ) − cos ⁡ ( k y − π / 3 ) sin ⁡ ( k z + π / 3 ) sin ⁡ ( k x + π / 2 ) ] e − 3 ν k 2 t {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}u_{x}&={\frac {4{\sqrt {2}}}{3{\sqrt {3}}}}\,U_{0}\left[\,\sin(kx-\pi /3)\cos(ky+\pi /3)\sin(kz+\pi /2)-\cos(kz-\pi /3)\sin(kx+\pi /3)\sin(ky+\pi /2)\,\right]e^{-3\nu k^{2}t}\\u_{y}&={\frac {4{\sqrt {2}}}{3{\sqrt {3}}}}\,U_{0}\left[\,\sin(ky-\pi /3)\cos(kz+\pi /3)\sin(kx+\pi /2)-\cos(kx-\pi /3)\sin(ky+\pi /3)\sin(kz+\pi /2)\,\right]e^{-3\nu k^{2}t}\\u_{z}&={\frac {4{\sqrt {2}}}{3{\sqrt {3}}}}\,U_{0}\left[\,\sin(kz-\pi /3)\cos(kx+\pi /3)\sin(ky+\pi /2)-\cos(ky-\pi /3)\sin(kz+\pi /3)\sin(kx+\pi /2)\,\right]e^{-3\nu k^{2}t}\end{aligned}}} where k = 2 π / L {\displaystyle k=2\pi /L} is the wave number and the velocity components are normalized so that the average kinetic energy per unit of mass is U 0 2 / 2 {\displaystyle U_{0}^{2}/2} at t = 0 {\displaystyle t=0} . The pressure field is obtained from the velocity field as p = p 0 − ρ 0 ‖ u ‖ 2 / 2 {\displaystyle p=p_{0}-\rho _{0}\|{\boldsymbol {u}}\|^{2}/2} (where p 0 {\displaystyle p_{0}} and ρ 0 {\displaystyle \rho _{0}} are reference values for the pressure and density fields respectively). Since both the solutions belong to the class of Beltrami flow , the vorticity field is parallel to the velocity and, for the case with positive helicity, is given by ω = 3 k u {\displaystyle \omega ={\sqrt {3}}\,k\,{\boldsymbol {u}}} . These solutions can be regarded as a generalization in three dimensions of the classic two-dimensional Taylor-Green Taylor–Green vortex . Wyld diagrams [ edit ] Wyld diagrams are bookkeeping graphs that correspond to the Navier–Stokes equations via a perturbation expansion of the fundamental continuum mechanics . Similar to the Feynman diagrams in quantum field theory , these diagrams are an extension of Keldysh 's technique for nonequilibrium processes in fluid dynamics. In other words, these diagrams assign graphs to the (often) turbulent phenomena in turbulent fluids by allowing correlated and interacting fluid particles to obey stochastic processes associated to pseudo-random functions in probability distributions . [39] Representations in 3D [ edit ] Note that the formulas in this section make use of the single-line notation for partial derivatives, where, e.g. ∂ x u {\textstyle \partial _{x}u} means the partial derivative of u {\textstyle u} with respect to x {\textstyle x} , and ∂ y 2 f θ {\textstyle \partial _{y}^{2}f_{\theta }} means the second-order partial derivative of f θ {\textstyle f_{\theta }} with respect to y {\textstyle y} . A 2022 paper provides a less costly, dynamical and recurrent solution of the Navier-Stokes equation for 3D turbulent fluid flows. On suitably short time scales, the dynamics of turbulence is deterministic. [40] Cartesian coordinates [ edit ] From the general form of the Navier–Stokes, with the velocity vector expanded as u = ( u x , u y , u z ) {\textstyle \mathbf {u} =(u_{x},u_{y},u_{z})} , sometimes respectively named u {\textstyle u} , v {\textstyle v} , w {\textstyle w} , we may write the vector equation explicitly, x : ρ ( ∂ t u x + u x ∂ x u x + u y ∂ y u x + u z ∂ z u x ) = − ∂ x p + μ ( ∂ x 2 u x + ∂ y 2 u x + ∂ z 2 u x ) + 1 3 μ ∂ x ( ∂ x u x + ∂ y u y + ∂ z u z ) + ρ g x {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x:\ &\rho \left({\partial _{t}u_{x}}+u_{x}\,{\partial _{x}u_{x}}+u_{y}\,{\partial _{y}u_{x}}+u_{z}\,{\partial _{z}u_{x}}\right)\\&\quad =-\partial _{x}p+\mu \left({\partial _{x}^{2}u_{x}}+{\partial _{y}^{2}u_{x}}+{\partial _{z}^{2}u_{x}}\right)+{\frac {1}{3}}\mu \ \partial _{x}\left({\partial _{x}u_{x}}+{\partial _{y}u_{y}}+{\partial _{z}u_{z}}\right)+\rho g_{x}\\\end{aligned}}} y : ρ ( ∂ t u y + u x ∂ x u y + u y ∂ y u y + u z ∂ z u y ) = − ∂ y p + μ ( ∂ x 2 u y + ∂ y 2 u y + ∂ z 2 u y ) + 1 3 μ ∂ y ( ∂ x u x + ∂ y u y + ∂ z u z ) + ρ g y {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}y:\ &\rho \left({\partial _{t}u_{y}}+u_{x}{\partial _{x}u_{y}}+u_{y}{\partial _{y}u_{y}}+u_{z}{\partial _{z}u_{y}}\right)\\&\quad =-{\partial _{y}p}+\mu \left({\partial _{x}^{2}u_{y}}+{\partial _{y}^{2}u_{y}}+{\partial _{z}^{2}u_{y}}\right)+{\frac {1}{3}}\mu \ \partial _{y}\left({\partial _{x}u_{x}}+{\partial _{y}u_{y}}+{\partial _{z}u_{z}}\right)+\rho g_{y}\\\end{aligned}}} z : ρ ( ∂ t u z + u x ∂ x u z + u y ∂ y u z + u z ∂ z u z ) = − ∂ z p + μ ( ∂ x 2 u z + ∂ y 2 u z + ∂ z 2 u z ) + 1 3 μ ∂ z ( ∂ x u x + ∂ y u y + ∂ z u z ) + ρ g z . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}z:\ &\rho \left({\partial _{t}u_{z}}+u_{x}{\partial _{x}u_{z}}+u_{y}{\partial _{y}u_{z}}+u_{z}{\partial _{z}u_{z}}\right)\\&\quad =-{\partial _{z}p}+\mu \left({\partial _{x}^{2}u_{z}}+{\partial _{y}^{2}u_{z}}+{\partial _{z}^{2}u_{z}}\right)+{\frac {1}{3}}\mu \ \partial _{z}\left({\partial _{x}u_{x}}+{\partial _{y}u_{y}}+{\partial _{z}u_{z}}\right)+\rho g_{z}.\end{aligned}}} Note that gravity has been accounted for as a body force, and the values of g x {\textstyle g_{x}} , g y {\textstyle g_{y}} , g z {\textstyle g_{z}} will depend on the orientation of gravity with respect to the chosen set of coordinates. The continuity equation reads: ∂ t ρ + ∂ x ( ρ u x ) + ∂ y ( ρ u y ) + ∂ z ( ρ u z ) = 0. {\displaystyle \partial _{t}\rho +\partial _{x}(\rho u_{x})+\partial _{y}(\rho u_{y})+\partial _{z}(\rho u_{z})=0.} When the flow is incompressible, ρ {\textstyle \rho } does not change for any fluid particle, and its material derivative vanishes: D ρ D t = 0 {\textstyle {\frac {\mathrm {D} \rho }{\mathrm {D} t}}=0} . The continuity equation is reduced to: ∂ x u x + ∂ y u y + ∂ z u z = 0. {\displaystyle \partial _{x}u_{x}+\partial _{y}u_{y}+\partial _{z}u_{z}=0.} Thus, for the incompressible version of the Navier–Stokes equation the second part of the viscous terms fall away (see Incompressible flow ). This system of four equations comprises the most commonly used and studied form. Though comparatively more compact than other representations, this is still a nonlinear system of partial differential equations for which solutions are difficult to obtain. Cylindrical coordinates [ edit ] A change of variables on the Cartesian equations will yield [16] the following momentum equations for r {\textstyle r} , ϕ {\textstyle \phi } , and z {\textstyle z} [41] r : ρ ( ∂ t u r + u r ∂ r u r + u φ r ∂ φ u r + u z ∂ z u r − u φ 2 r ) = − ∂ r p + μ ( 1 r ∂ r ( r ∂ r u r ) + 1 r 2 ∂ φ 2 u r + ∂ z 2 u r − u r r 2 − 2 r 2 ∂ φ u φ ) + 1 3 μ ∂ r ( 1 r ∂ r ( r u r ) + 1 r ∂ φ u φ + ∂ z u z ) + ρ g r {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}r:\ &\rho \left({\partial _{t}u_{r}}+u_{r}{\partial _{r}u_{r}}+{\frac {u_{\varphi }}{r}}{\partial _{\varphi }u_{r}}+u_{z}{\partial _{z}u_{r}}-{\frac {u_{\varphi }^{2}}{r}}\right)\\&\quad =-{\partial _{r}p}\\&\qquad +\mu \left({\frac {1}{r}}\partial _{r}\left(r{\partial _{r}u_{r}}\right)+{\frac {1}{r^{2}}}{\partial _{\varphi }^{2}u_{r}}+{\partial _{z}^{2}u_{r}}-{\frac {u_{r}}{r^{2}}}-{\frac {2}{r^{2}}}{\partial _{\varphi }u_{\varphi }}\right)\\&\qquad +{\frac {1}{3}}\mu \partial _{r}\left({\frac {1}{r}}{\partial _{r}\left(ru_{r}\right)}+{\frac {1}{r}}{\partial _{\varphi }u_{\varphi }}+{\partial _{z}u_{z}}\right)\\&\qquad +\rho g_{r}\\[8px]\end{aligned}}} φ : ρ ( ∂ t u φ + u r ∂ r u φ + u φ r ∂ φ u φ + u z ∂ z u φ + u r u φ r ) = − 1 r ∂ φ p + μ ( 1 r ∂ r ( r ∂ r u φ ) + 1 r 2 ∂ φ 2 u φ + ∂ z 2 u φ − u φ r 2 + 2 r 2 ∂ φ u r ) + 1 3 μ 1 r ∂ φ ( 1 r ∂ r ( r u r ) + 1 r ∂ φ u φ + ∂ z u z ) + ρ g φ {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\varphi :\ &\rho \left({\partial _{t}u_{\varphi }}+u_{r}{\partial _{r}u_{\varphi }}+{\frac {u_{\varphi }}{r}}{\partial _{\varphi }u_{\varphi }}+u_{z}{\partial _{z}u_{\varphi }}+{\frac {u_{r}u_{\varphi }}{r}}\right)\\&\quad =-{\frac {1}{r}}{\partial _{\varphi }p}\\&\qquad +\mu \left({\frac {1}{r}}\ \partial _{r}\left(r{\partial _{r}u_{\varphi }}\right)+{\frac {1}{r^{2}}}{\partial _{\varphi }^{2}u_{\varphi }}+{\partial _{z}^{2}u_{\varphi }}-{\frac {u_{\varphi }}{r^{2}}}+{\frac {2}{r^{2}}}{\partial _{\varphi }u_{r}}\right)\\&\qquad +{\frac {1}{3}}\mu {\frac {1}{r}}\partial _{\varphi }\left({\frac {1}{r}}{\partial _{r}\left(ru_{r}\right)}+{\frac {1}{r}}{\partial _{\varphi }u_{\varphi }}+{\partial _{z}u_{z}}\right)\\&\qquad +\rho g_{\varphi }\\[8px]\end{aligned}}} z : ρ ( ∂ t u z + u r ∂ r u z + u φ r ∂ φ u z + u z ∂ z u z ) = − ∂ z p + μ ( 1 r ∂ r ( r ∂ r u z ) + 1 r 2 ∂ φ 2 u z + ∂ z 2 u z ) + 1 3 μ ∂ z ( 1 r ∂ r ( r u r ) + 1 r ∂ φ u φ + ∂ z u z ) + ρ g z . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}z:\ &\rho \left({\partial _{t}u_{z}}+u_{r}{\partial _{r}u_{z}}+{\frac {u_{\varphi }}{r}}{\partial _{\varphi }u_{z}}+u_{z}{\partial _{z}u_{z}}\right)\\&\quad =-{\partial _{z}p}\\&\qquad +\mu \left({\frac {1}{r}}\partial _{r}\left(r{\partial _{r}u_{z}}\right)+{\frac {1}{r^{2}}}{\partial _{\varphi }^{2}u_{z}}+{\partial _{z}^{2}u_{z}}\right)\\&\qquad +{\frac {1}{3}}\mu \partial _{z}\left({\frac {1}{r}}{\partial _{r}\left(ru_{r}\right)}+{\frac {1}{r}}{\partial _{\varphi }u_{\varphi }}+{\partial _{z}u_{z}}\right)\\&\qquad +\rho g_{z}.\end{aligned}}} The gravity components will generally not be constants, however for most applications either the coordinates are chosen so that the gravity components are constant or else it is assumed that gravity is counteracted by a pressure field (for example, flow in horizontal pipe is treated normally without gravity and without a vertical pressure gradient). The continuity equation is: ∂ t ρ + 1 r ∂ r ( ρ r u r ) + 1 r ∂ φ ( ρ u φ ) + ∂ z ( ρ u z ) = 0. {\displaystyle {\partial _{t}\rho }+{\frac {1}{r}}\partial _{r}\left(\rho ru_{r}\right)+{\frac {1}{r}}{\partial _{\varphi }\left(\rho u_{\varphi }\right)}+{\partial _{z}\left(\rho u_{z}\right)}=0.} This cylindrical representation of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations is the second most commonly seen (the first being Cartesian above). Cylindrical coordinates are chosen to take advantage of symmetry, so that a velocity component can disappear. A very common case is axisymmetric flow with the assumption of no tangential velocity ( u ϕ = 0 {\textstyle u_{\phi }=0} ), and the remaining quantities are independent of ϕ {\textstyle \phi } : ρ ( ∂

Navier–Stokes equations use in games [ edit ] The Navier–Stokes equations are used extensively in video games in order to model a wide variety of natural phenomena. Simulations of small-scale gaseous fluids, such as fire and smoke, are often based on the seminal paper ""Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games"" [43] by Jos Stam , which elaborates one of the methods proposed in Stam's earlier, more famous paper ""Stable Fluids"" [44] from 1999. Stam proposes stable fluid simulation using a Navier–Stokes solution method from 1968, coupled with an unconditionally stable semi-Lagrangian advection scheme, as first proposed in 1992. More recent implementations based upon this work run on the game systems graphics processing unit (GPU) as opposed to the central processing unit (CPU) and achieve a much higher degree of performance. [45] [46] Many improvements have been proposed to Stam's original work, which suffers inherently from high numerical dissipation in both velocity and mass. An introduction to interactive fluid simulation can be found in the 2007 ACM SIGGRAPH course, Fluid Simulation for Computer Animation.

The wave steepness is: ka = 0.3, with k the wavenumber and a the wave amplitude . Typical for these surface gravity waves are the sharp crests and flat troughs . Model testing with periodic waves in the wave–tow tank of the Jere A. Chase Ocean Engineering Laboratory, University of New Hampshire . Undular bore and whelps near the mouth of Araguari River in north-eastern Brazil. View is oblique toward mouth from airplane at approximately 100 ft (30 m) altitude. [1] The undulations following behind the bore front appear as slowly modulated Stokes waves. In fluid dynamics , a Stokes wave is a nonlinear and periodic surface wave on an inviscid fluid layer of constant mean depth. This type of modelling has its origins in the mid 19th century when Sir George Stokes – using a perturbation series approach, now known as the Stokes expansion – obtained approximate solutions for nonlinear wave motion. Stokes's wave theory is of direct practical use for waves on intermediate and deep water. It is used in the design of coastal and offshore structures , in order to determine the wave kinematics ( free surface elevation and flow velocities ). The wave kinematics are subsequently needed in the design process to determine the wave loads on a structure. [2] For long waves (as compared to depth) – and using only a few terms in the Stokes expansion – its applicability is limited to waves of small amplitude . In such shallow water, a cnoidal wave theory often provides better periodic-wave approximations. While, in the strict sense, Stokes wave refers to a progressive periodic wave of permanent form, the term is also used in connection with standing waves [3] and even random waves. [4] [5] Examples [ edit ] The examples below describe Stokes waves under the action of gravity (without surface tension effects) in case of pure wave motion, so without an ambient mean current. Third-order Stokes wave on deep water [ edit ] Third-order Stokes wave in deep water under the action of gravity. The wave steepness is: ka = 0.3. The three harmonics contributing to the surface elevation of a deep water wave, according to Stokes's third-order theory. The wave steepness is: ka = 0.3. For visibility, the vertical scale is distorted by a factor of four, compared to the horizontal scale. Description: * the dark blue line is the surface elevation of the 3rd-order Stokes wave, * the black line is the fundamental wave component, with wavenumber k ( wavelength λ, k = 2 π / λ ), * the light blue line is the harmonic at 2 k (wavelength 1 ⁄ 2 λ), and * the red line is the harmonic at 3 k (wavelength 1 ⁄ 3 λ). According to Stokes's third-order theory, the free surface elevation η , the velocity potential Φ, the phase speed (or celerity) c and the wave phase θ are, for a progressive surface gravity wave on deep water – i.e. the fluid layer has infinite depth: [6] η ( x , t ) = a { [ 1 − 1 16 ( k a ) 2 ] cos ⁡ θ + 1 2 ( k a ) cos ⁡ 2 θ + 3 8 ( k a ) 2 cos ⁡ 3 θ } + O ( ( k a ) 4 ) , Φ ( x , z , t ) = a g k e k z sin ⁡ θ + O ( ( k a ) 4 ) , c = ω k = ( 1 + 1 2 ( k a ) 2 ) g k + O ( ( k a ) 4 ) , and θ ( x , t ) = k x − ω t , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\eta (x,t)=&a\left\{\left[1-{\tfrac {1}{16}}(ka)^{2}\right]\cos \theta +{\tfrac {1}{2}}(ka)\,\cos 2\theta +{\tfrac {3}{8}}(ka)^{2}\,\cos 3\theta \right\}+{\mathcal {O}}\left((ka)^{4}\right),\\\Phi (x,z,t)=&a{\sqrt {\frac {g}{k}}}\,{\text{e}}^{kz}\,\sin \theta +{\mathcal {O}}\left((ka)^{4}\right),\\c=&{\frac {\omega }{k}}=\left(1+{\tfrac {1}{2}}(ka)^{2}\right)\,{\sqrt {\frac {g}{k}}}+{\mathcal {O}}\left((ka)^{4}\right),{\text{ and}}\\\theta (x,t)=&kx-\omega t,\end{aligned}}} where x is the horizontal coordinate; z is the vertical coordinate, with the positive z -direction upward – opposing to the direction of the Earth's gravity – and z = 0 corresponding with the mean surface elevation; t is time; a is the first-order wave amplitude ; k is the angular wavenumber , k = 2 π / λ with λ being the wavelength ; ω is the angular frequency , ω = 2 π / τ where τ is the period , and g is the strength of the Earth's gravity, a constant in this approximation. The expansion parameter ka is known as the wave steepness. The phase speed increases with increasing nonlinearity ka of the waves. The wave height H , being the difference between the surface elevation η at a crest and a trough , is: [7] H = 2 a ( 1 + 3 8 k 2 a 2 ) . {\displaystyle H=2a\,\left(1+{\tfrac {3}{8}}\,k^{2}a^{2}\right).} Note that the second- and third-order terms in the velocity potential Φ are zero. Only at fourth order do contributions deviating from first-order theory – i.e. Airy wave theory – appear. [6] Up to third order the orbital velocity field u = ∇ Φ consists of a circular motion of the velocity vector at each position ( x , z ). As a result, the surface elevation of deep-water waves is to a good approximation trochoidal , as already noted by Stokes (1847) . [8] Stokes further observed, that although (in this Eulerian description) the third-order orbital velocity field consists of a circular motion at each point, the Lagrangian paths of fluid parcels are not closed circles. This is due to the reduction of the velocity amplitude at increasing depth below the surface. This Lagrangian drift of the fluid parcels is known as the Stokes drift . [8] Second-order Stokes wave on arbitrary depth [ edit ] The ratio S = a 2 / a of the amplitude a 2 of the harmonic with twice the wavenumber (2 k ), to the amplitude a of the fundamental , according to Stokes's second-order theory for surface gravity waves. On the horizontal axis is the relative water depth h / λ, with h the mean depth and λ the wavelength , while the vertical axis is the Stokes parameter S divided by the wave steepness ka (with k = 2 π / λ ). Description: * the blue line is valid for arbitrary water depth, while * the dashed red line is the shallow-water limit (water depth small compared to the wavelength), and * the dash-dot green line is the asymptotic limit for deep water waves. The surface elevation η and the velocity potential Φ are, according to Stokes's second-order theory of surface gravity waves on a fluid layer of mean depth h : [6] [9] η ( x , t ) = a { cos θ + k a 3 − σ 2 4 σ 3 cos 2 θ } + O ( ( k a ) 3 ) , Φ ( x , z , t ) = a ω k 1 sinh k h × { cosh k ( z + h ) sin θ + k a 3 cosh 2 k ( z + h ) 8 sinh 3 k h sin 2 θ } − ( k a ) 2 1 2 sinh 2 k h g t k + O ( ( k a ) 3 ) , c = ω k = g k σ + O ( ( k a ) 2 ) , σ = tanh k h and θ ( x , t ) = k x − ω t . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\eta (x,t)=&a\left\{\cos \,\theta +ka\,{\frac {3-\sigma ^{2}}{4\,\sigma ^{3}}}\,\cos \,2\theta \right\}+{\mathcal {O}}\left((ka)^{3}\right),\\\Phi (x,z,t)=&a\,{\frac {\omega }{k}}\,{\frac {1}{\sinh \,kh}}\\&\times \left\{\cosh \,k(z+h)\sin \,\theta +ka\,{\frac {3\cosh \,2k(z+h)}{8\,\sinh ^{3}\,kh}}\,\sin \,2\theta \right\}\\&-(ka)^{2}\,{\frac {1}{2\,\sinh \,2kh}}\,{\frac {g\,t}{k}}+{\mathcal {O}}\left((ka)^{3}\right),\\c=&{\frac {\omega }{k}}={\sqrt {{\frac {g}{k}}\,\sigma }}+{\mathcal {O}}\left((ka)^{2}\right),\\\sigma =&\tanh \,kh\quad {\text{and}}\quad \theta (x,t)=kx-\omega t.\end{aligned}}} Observe that for finite depth the velocity potential Φ contains a linear drift in time, independent of position ( x and z ). Both this temporal drift and the double-frequency term (containing sin 2θ) in Φ vanish for deep-water waves. Stokes and Ursell parameters [ edit ] Further information: Ursell parameter The ratio S of the free-surface amplitudes at second order and first order – according to Stokes's second-order theory – is: [6] S = k a 3 − tanh 2 k h 4 tanh 3 k h . {\displaystyle {\mathcal {S}}=ka\,{\frac {3-\tanh ^{2}\,kh}{4\,\tanh ^{3}\,kh}}.} In deep water, for large kh the ratio S has the asymptote lim k h → ∞ S = 1 2 k a . {\displaystyle \lim _{kh\to \infty }{\mathcal {S}}={\frac {1}{2}}\,ka.} For long waves, i.e. small kh , the ratio S behaves as lim k h ↓ 0 S = 3 4 k a ( k h ) 3 , {\displaystyle \lim _{kh\downarrow 0}{\mathcal {S}}={\frac {3}{4}}\,{\frac {ka}{(kh)^{3}}},} or, in terms of the wave height H = 2 a and wavelength λ = 2 π / k : lim k h ↓ 0 S = 3 32 π 2 H λ 2 h 3 = 3 32 π 2 U , {\displaystyle \lim _{kh\downarrow 0}{\mathcal {S}}={\frac {3}{32\,\pi ^{2}}}\,{\frac {H\,\lambda ^{2}}{h^{3}}}={\frac {3}{32\,\pi ^{2}}}\,{\mathcal {U}},} with U ≡ H λ 2 h 3 . {\displaystyle {\mathcal {U}}\equiv {\frac {H\,\lambda ^{2}}{h^{3}}}.} Here U is the Ursell parameter (or Stokes parameter). For long waves ( λ ≫ h ) of small height H , i.e. U ≪ 32π 2 /3 ≈ 100 , second-order Stokes theory is applicable. Otherwise, for fairly long waves ( λ > 7 h ) of appreciable height H a cnoidal wave description is more appropriate. [6] According to Hedges, fifth-order Stokes theory is applicable for U < 40 , and otherwise fifth-order cnoidal wave theory is preferable. [10] [11] Third-order dispersion relation [ edit ] Nonlinear enhancement of the phase speed c = ω / k – according to Stokes's third-order theory for surface gravity waves , and using Stokes's first definition of celerity – as compared to the linear-theory phase speed c 0 . On the horizontal axis is the relative water depth h / λ, with h the mean depth and λ the wavelength , while the vertical axis is the nonlinear phase-speed enhancement ( c − c 0 ) / c 0 divided by the wave steepness ka squared. Description: * the solid blue line is valid for arbitrary water depth, * the dashed red line is the shallow-water limit (water depth small compared to the wavelength), and * the dash-dot green line is the asymptotic limit for deep water waves. For Stokes waves under the action of gravity, the third-order dispersion relation is – according to Stokes's first definition of celerity : [9] ω 2 = ( g k tanh k h ) { 1 + 9 − 10 σ 2 + 9 σ 4 8 σ 4 ( k a ) 2 } + O ( ( k a ) 4 ) , with σ = tanh k h . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\omega ^{2}&=\left(gk\,\tanh \,kh\right)\;\left\{1+{\frac {9-10\,\sigma ^{2}+9\,\sigma ^{4}}{8\,\sigma ^{4}}}\,(ka)^{2}\right\}+{\mathcal {O}}\left((ka)^{4}\right),\\&\qquad {\text{with}}\\\sigma &=\tanh \,kh.\end{aligned}}} This third-order dispersion relation is a direct consequence of avoiding secular terms , when inserting the second-order Stokes solution into the third-order equations (of the perturbation series for the periodic wave problem). In deep water (short wavelength compared to the depth): lim k h → ∞ ω 2 = g k { 1 + ( k a ) 2 } + O ( ( k a ) 4 ) , {\displaystyle \lim _{kh\to \infty }\omega ^{2}=gk\,\left\{1+\left(ka\right)^{2}\right\}+{\mathcal {O}}\left((ka)^{4}\right),} and in shallow water (long wavelengths compared to the depth): lim k h ↓ 0 ω 2 = k 2 g h { 1 + 9 8 ( k a ) 2 ( k h ) 4 } + O ( ( k a ) 4 ) . {\displaystyle \lim _{kh\downarrow 0}\omega ^{2}=k^{2}\,gh\,\left\{1+{\frac {9}{8}}\,{\frac {\left(ka\right)^{2}}{\left(kh\right)^{4}}}\right\}+{\mathcal {O}}\left((ka)^{4}\right).} As shown above , the long-wave Stokes expansion for the dispersion relation will only be valid for small enough values of the Ursell parameter: U ≪ 100 . Overview [ edit ] Stokes's approach to the nonlinear wave problem [ edit ] Waves in the Kelvin wake pattern generated by a ship on the Maas–Waalkanaal in The Netherlands. The transverse waves in this Kelvin wake pattern are nearly plane Stokes waves. NOAA ship Delaware II in bad weather on Georges Bank . While these ocean waves are random , and not Stokes waves (in the strict sense), they indicate the typical sharp crests and flat troughs as found in nonlinear surface gravity waves. A fundamental problem in finding solutions for surface gravity waves is that boundary conditions have to be applied at the position of the free surface , which is not known beforehand and is thus a part of the solution to be found. Sir George Stokes solved this nonlinear wave problem in 1847 by expanding the relevant potential flow quantities in a Taylor series around the mean (or still) surface elevation. [12] As a result, the boundary conditions can be expressed in terms of quantities at the mean (or still) surface elevation (which is fixed and known). Next, a solution for the nonlinear wave problem (including the Taylor series expansion around the mean or still surface elevation) is sought by means of a perturbation series – known as the Stokes expansion – in terms of a small parameter, most often the wave steepness. The unknown terms in the expansion can be solved sequentially. [6] [8] Often, only a small number of terms is needed to provide a solution of sufficient accuracy for engineering purposes. [11] Typical applications are in the design of coastal and offshore structures , and of ships . Another property of nonlinear waves is that the phase speed of nonlinear waves depends on the wave height . In a perturbation-series approach, this easily gives rise to a spurious secular variation of the solution, in contradiction with the periodic behaviour of the waves. Stokes solved this problem by also expanding the dispersion relationship into a perturbation series, by a method now known as the Lindstedt–Poincaré method . [6] Applicability [ edit ] Validity of several theories for periodic water waves, according to Le Méhauté (1976). [13] The light-blue area gives the range of validity of cnoidal wave theory; light-yellow for Airy wave theory ; and the dashed blue lines demarcate between the required order in Stokes's wave theory. The light-gray shading gives the range extension by numerical approximations using fifth-order stream-function theory, for high waves ( H > 1 ⁄ 4 H breaking ). Stokes's wave theory , when using a low order of the perturbation expansion (e.g. up to second, third or fifth order), is valid for nonlinear waves on intermediate and deep water, that is for wavelengths ( λ ) not large as compared with the mean depth ( h ). In shallow water , the low-order Stokes expansion breaks down (gives unrealistic results) for appreciable wave amplitude (as compared to the depth). Then, Boussinesq approximations are more appropriate. Further approximations on Boussinesq-type (multi-directional) wave equations lead – for one-way wave propagation – to the Korteweg–de Vries equation or the Benjamin–Bona–Mahony equation . Like (near) exact Stokes-wave solutions, [14] these two equations have solitary wave ( soliton ) solutions, besides periodic-wave solutions known as cnoidal waves . [11] Modern extensions [ edit ] Already in 1914, Wilton extended the Stokes expansion for deep-water surface gravity waves to tenth order, although introducing errors at the eight order. [15] A fifth-order theory for finite depth was derived by De in 1955. [16] For engineering use, the fifth-order formulations of Fenton are convenient, applicable to both Stokes first and second definition of phase speed (celerity). [17] The demarcation between when fifth-order Stokes theory is preferable over fifth-order cnoidal wave theory is for Ursell parameters below about 40. [10] [11] Different choices for the frame of reference and expansion parameters are possible in Stokes-like approaches to the nonlinear wave problem. In 1880, Stokes himself inverted the dependent and independent variables, by taking the velocity potential and stream function as the independent variables, and the coordinates ( x , z ) as the dependent variables, with x and z being the horizontal and vertical coordinates respectively. [18] This has the advantage that the free surface, in a frame of reference in which the wave is steady (i.e. moving with the phase velocity), corresponds with a line on which the stream function is a constant. Then the free surface location is known beforehand, and not an unknown part of the solution. The disadvantage is that the radius of convergence of the rephrased series expansion reduces. [19] Another approach is by using the Lagrangian frame of reference , following the fluid parcels . The Lagrangian formulations show enhanced convergence, as compared to the formulations in both the Eulerian frame , and in the frame with the potential and streamfunction as independent variables. [20] [21] An exact solution for nonlinear pure capillary waves of permanent form, and for infinite fluid depth, was obtained by Crapper in 1957. Note that these capillary waves – being short waves forced by surface tension , if gravity effects are negligible – have sharp troughs and flat crests. This contrasts with nonlinear surface gravity waves, which have sharp crests and flat troughs. [22] Several integral properties of Stokes waves on deep water as a function of wave steepness. [23] The wave steepness is defined as the ratio of wave height H to the wavelength λ. The wave properties are made dimensionless using the wavenumber k = 2π / λ , gravitational acceleration g and the fluid density ρ . Shown are the kinetic energy density T , the potential energy density V , the total energy density E = T + V , the horizontal wave momentum density I , and the relative enhancement of the phase speed c . Wave energy densities T , V and E are integrated over depth and averaged over one wavelength, so they are energies per unit of horizontal area; the wave momentum density I is similar. The dashed black lines show 1/16 ( kH ) 2 and 1/8 ( kH ) 2 , being the values of the integral properties as derived from (linear) Airy wave theory . The maximum wave height occurs for a wave steepness H / λ ≈ 0.1412 , above which no periodic surface gravity waves exist. [24] Note that the shown wave properties have a maximum for a wave height less than the maximum wave height (see e.g. Longuet-Higgins 1975 ; Cokelet 1977 ). By use of computer models, the Stokes expansion for surface gravity waves has been continued, up to high (117th) order by Schwartz (1974) . Schwartz has found that the amplitude a (or a 1 ) of the first-order fundamental reaches a maximum before the maximum wave height H is reached. Consequently, the wave steepness ka in terms of wave amplitude is not a monotone function up to the highest wave, and Schwartz utilizes instead kH as the expansion parameter. To estimate the highest wave in deep water, Schwartz has used Padé approximants and Domb–Sykes plots in order to improve the convergence of the Stokes expansion. Extended tables of Stokes waves on various depths, computed by a different method (but in accordance with the results by others), are provided in Williams ( 1981 , 1985 ). Several exact relationships exist between integral properties – such as kinetic and potential energy , horizontal wave momentum and radiation stress – as found by Longuet-Higgins (1975) . He shows, for deep-water waves, that many of these integral properties have a maximum before the maximum wave height is reached (in support of Schwartz's findings). Cokelet (1978) harvtxt error: no target: CITEREFCokelet1978 ( help ) , using a method similar to the one of Schwartz, computed and tabulated integral properties for a wide range of finite water depths (all reaching maxima below the highest wave height). Further, these integral properties play an important role in the conservation laws for water waves, through Noether's theorem . [25] In 2005, Hammack, Henderson and Segur have provided the first experimental evidence for the existence of three-dimensional progressive waves of permanent form in deep water – that is bi-periodic and two-dimensional progressive wave patterns of permanent form. [26] The existence of these three-dimensional steady deep-water waves has been revealed in 2002, from a bifurcation study of two-dimensional Stokes waves by Craig and Nicholls, using numerical methods. [27] Convergence and instability [ edit ] Convergence [ edit ] Convergence of the Stokes expansion was first proved by Levi-Civita (1925) for the case of small-amplitude waves – on the free surface of a fluid of infinite depth. This was extended shortly afterwards by Struik (1926) for the case of finite depth and small-amplitude waves. [28] Near the end of the 20th century, it was shown that for finite-amplitude waves the convergence of the Stokes expansion depends strongly on the formulation of the periodic wave problem. For instance, an inverse formulation of the periodic wave problem as used by Stokes – with the spatial coordinates as a function of velocity potential and stream function – does not converge for high-amplitude waves. While other formulations converge much more rapidly, e.g. in the Eulerian frame of reference (with the velocity potential or stream function as a function of the spatial coordinates). [19] Highest wave [ edit ] Stokes waves of maximum wave height on deep water, under the action of gravity. The maximum wave steepness, for periodic and propagating deep-water waves, is H / λ = 0.1410633 ± 4 · 10 −7 , [29] so the wave height is about one-seventh ( ⁠ 1 / 7 ⁠ ) of the wavelength λ. [24] And surface gravity waves of this maximum height have a sharp wave crest – with an angle of 120° (in the fluid domain) – also for finite depth, as shown by Stokes in 1880. [18] An accurate estimate of the highest wave steepness in deep water ( H / λ ≈ 0.142 ) was already made in 1893, by John Henry Michell , using a numerical method. [30] A more detailed study of the behaviour of the highest wave near the sharp-cornered crest has been published by Malcolm A. Grant, in 1973. [31] The existence of the highest wave on deep water with a sharp-angled crest of 120° was proved by John Toland in 1978. [32] The convexity of η(x) between the successive maxima with a sharp-angled crest of 120° was independently proven by C.J. Amick et al. and Pavel I. Plotnikov in 1982 . [33] [34] The highest Stokes wave – under the action of gravity – can be approximated with the following simple and accurate representation of the free surface elevation η ( x , t ): [35] η λ = A [ cosh ( x − c t λ ) − 1 ] , {\displaystyle {\frac {\eta }{\lambda }}=A\,\left[\cosh \,\left({\frac {x-ct}{\lambda }}\right)-1\right],} with A = 1 3 sinh ⁡ ( 1 2 ) ≈ 1.108 , {\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{{\sqrt {3}}\,\sinh \left({\frac {1}{2}}\right)}}\approx 1.108,} for − 1 2 λ ≤ ( x − c t ) ≤ 1 2 λ , {\displaystyle -{\tfrac {1}{2}}\,\lambda \leq (x-ct)\leq {\tfrac {1}{2}}\,\lambda ,} and shifted horizontally over an integer number of wavelengths to represent the other waves in the regular wave train. This approximation is accurate to within 0.7% everywhere, as compared with the ""exact"" solution for the highest wave. [35] Another accurate approximation – however less accurate than the previous one – of the fluid motion on the surface of the steepest wave is by analogy with the swing of a pendulum in a grandfather clock . [36] Large library of Stokes waves computed with high precision for the case of infinite depth, represented with high accuracy (at least 27 digits after decimal point) as a Padé approximant can be found at StokesWave.org [37] Instability [ edit ] In deeper water, Stokes waves are unstable. [38] This was shown by T. Brooke Benjamin and Jim E. Feir in 1967. [39] [40] The Benjamin–Feir instability is a side-band or modulational instability, with the side-band modulations propagating in the same direction as the carrier wave ; waves become unstable on deeper water for a relative depth kh > 1.363 (with k the wavenumber and h the mean water depth). [41] The Benjamin–Feir instability can be described with the nonlinear Schrödinger equation , by inserting a Stokes wave with side bands. [38] Subsequently, with a more refined analysis, it has been shown – theoretically and experimentally – that the Stokes wave and its side bands exhibit Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou recurrence : a cyclic alternation between modulation and demodulation. [42] In 1978 Longuet-Higgins , by means of numerical modelling of fully non-linear waves and modulations (propagating in the carrier wave direction), presented a detailed analysis of the region of instability in deep water: both for superharmonics (for perturbations at the spatial scales smaller than the wavelength λ {\displaystyle \lambda } ) [43] and subharmonics (for perturbations at the spatial scales larger than λ {\displaystyle \lambda } ). [44] With increase of Stokes wave's amplitude, new modes of superharmonic instability appear. Appearance of a new branch of instability happens when the energy of the wave passes extremum. Detailed analysis of the mechanism of appearance of the new branches of instability has shown that their behavior follows closely a simple law, which allows to find with a good accuracy instability growth rates for all known and predicted branches. [45] In Longuet-Higgins studies of two-dimensional wave motion, as well as the subsequent studies of three-dimensional modulations by McLean et al., new types of instabilities were found – these are associated with resonant wave interactions between five (or more) wave components. [46] [47] [48] Stokes expansion [ edit ] Governing equations for a potential flow [ edit ] In many instances, the oscillatory flow in the fluid interior of surface waves can be described accurately using potential flow theory, apart from boundary layers near the free surface and bottom (where vorticity is important, due to viscous effects , see Stokes boundary layer ). [49] Then, the flow velocity u can be described as the gradient of a velocity potential Φ {\displaystyle \Phi } : u = ∇ Φ . {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} ={\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\Phi .} ( A ) Consequently, assuming incompressible flow , the velocity field u is divergence-free and the velocity potential Φ {\displaystyle \Phi } satisfies Laplace's equation [49] ∇ 2 Φ = 0 {\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}\Phi =0} ( B ) in the fluid interior. The fluid region is described using three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates ( x , y , z ), with x and y the horizontal coordinates, and z the vertical coordinate – with the positive z -direction opposing the direction of the gravitational acceleration . Time is denoted with t . The free surface is located at z = η ( x , y , t ) , and the bottom of the fluid region is at z = − h ( x , y ) . The free-surface boundary conditions for surface gravity waves – using a potential flow description – consist of a kinematic and a dynamic boundary condition. [50] The kinematic boundary condition ensures that the normal component of the fluid's flow velocity , u = [ ∂ Φ / ∂ x ∂ Φ / ∂ y ∂ Φ / ∂ z ] T {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} =[\partial \Phi /\partial x~~~\partial \Phi /\partial y~~~\partial \Phi /\partial z]^{\mathrm {T} }} in matrix notation, at the free surface equals the normal velocity component of the free-surface motion z = η ( x , y , t ) : ∂ η ∂ t + ∂ Φ ∂ x ∂ η ∂ x + ∂ Φ ∂ y ∂ η ∂ y = ∂ Φ ∂ z at z = η ( x , y , t ) . {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \eta }{\partial t}}+{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial x}}\,{\frac {\partial \eta }{\partial x}}+{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial y}}\,{\frac {\partial \eta }{\partial y}}={\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial z}}\qquad {\text{ at }}z=\eta (x,y,t).} ( C ) The dynamic boundary condition states that, without surface tension effects, the atmospheric pressure just above the free surface equals the fluid pressure just below the surface. For an unsteady potential flow this means that the Bernoulli equation is to be applied at the free surface. In case of a constant atmospheric pressure, the dynamic boundary condition becomes: ∂ Φ ∂ t + 1 2 | u | 2 + g η = 0 at z = η ( x , y , t ) , {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial t}}+{\tfrac {1}{2}}\,\left|\mathbf {u} \right|^{2}+g\,\eta =0\qquad {\text{ at }}z=\eta (x,y,t),} ( D ) where the constant atmospheric pressure has been taken equal to zero, without loss of generality . Both boundary conditions contain the potential Φ {\displaystyle \Phi } as well as the surface elevation η . A (dynamic) boundary condition in terms of only the potential Φ {\displaystyle \Phi } can be constructed by taking the material derivative of the dynamic boundary condition, and using the kinematic boundary condition: [49] [50] [51] ( ∂ ∂ t + u ⋅ ∇ ) ( ∂ Φ ∂ t + 1 2 | u | 2 + g η ) = 0 {\displaystyle {\color {Gray}{{\Bigl (}{\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}+\mathbf {u} \cdot {\boldsymbol {\nabla }}{\Bigr )}\,\left({\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial t}}+{\tfrac {1}{2}}\,|\mathbf {u} |^{2}+g\,\eta \right)=0}}} ⇒ ∂ 2 Φ ∂ t 2 + g ∂ Φ ∂ z + u ⋅ ∇ ∂ Φ ∂ t + 1 2 ∂ ∂ t ( | u | 2 ) + 1 2 u ⋅ ∇ ( | u | 2 ) = 0 {\displaystyle {\color {Gray}{\Rightarrow \quad {\frac {\partial ^{2}\Phi }{\partial t^{2}}}+g\,{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial z}}+\mathbf {u} \cdot {\boldsymbol {\nabla }}{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial t}}+{\tfrac {1}{2}}\,{\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}\left(|\mathbf {u} |^{2}\right)+{\tfrac {1}{2}}\,\mathbf {u} \cdot {\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\left(|\mathbf {u} |^{2}\right)=0}}} ⇒ ∂ 2 Φ ∂ t 2 + g ∂ Φ ∂ z + ∂ ∂ t ( | u | 2 ) + 1 2 u ⋅ ∇ ( | u | 2 ) = 0 at z = η ( x , y , t ) . {\displaystyle {\color {Gray}{\Rightarrow \quad }}{\frac {\partial ^{2}\Phi }{\partial t^{2}}}+g\,{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial z}}+{\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}\left(|\mathbf {u} |^{2}\right)+{\tfrac {1}{2}}\,\mathbf {u} \cdot {\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\left(|\mathbf {u} |^{2}\right)=0\qquad {\text{ at }}z=\eta (x,y,t).} ( E ) At the bottom of the fluid layer, impermeability requires the normal component of the flow velocity to vanish: [49] ∂ Φ ∂ n = 1 1 + ( ∂ h ∂ x ) 2 + ( ∂ h ∂ y ) 2 { ∂ Φ ∂ z + ∂ h ∂ x ∂ Φ ∂ x + ∂ h ∂ y ∂ Φ ∂ y } = 0 , at z = − h ( x , y ) , {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial n}}={\frac {1}{\sqrt {1+\left({\frac {\partial h}{\partial x}}\right)^{2}+\left({\frac {\partial h}{\partial y}}\right)^{2}}}}\,\left\{{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial z}}+{\frac {\partial h}{\partial x}}\,{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial x}}+{\frac {\partial h}{\partial y}}\,{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial y}}\right\}=0,\qquad {\text{ at }}z=-h(x,y),} ( F ) where h ( x , y ) is the depth of the bed below the datum z = 0 and n is the coordinate component in the direction normal to the bed . For permanent waves above a horizontal bed, the mean depth h is a constant and the boundary condition at the bed becomes: ∂ Φ ∂ z = 0 at z = − h . {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial z}}=0\qquad {\text{ at }}z=-h.} Taylor series in the free-surface boundary conditions [ edit ] The free-surface boundary conditions (D) and (E) apply at the yet unknown free-surface elevation z = η ( x , y , t ) . They can be transformed into boundary conditions at a fixed elevation z = constant by use of Taylor series expansions of the flow field around that elevation. [49] Without loss of generality the mean surface elevation – around which the Taylor series are developed – can be taken at z = 0 . This assures the expansion is around an elevation in the proximity of the actual free-surface elevation. Convergence of the Taylor series for small-amplitude steady-wave motion was proved by Levi-Civita (1925) . The following notation is used: the Taylor series of some field f ( x , y , z , t ) around z = 0 – and evaluated at z = η ( x , y , t ) – is: [52] f ( x , y , η , t ) = [ f ] 0 + η [ ∂ f ∂ z ] 0 + 1 2 η 2 [ ∂ 2 f ∂ z 2 ] 0 + ⋯ {\displaystyle f(x,y,\eta ,t)=\left[f\right]_{0}+\eta \,\left[{\frac {\partial f}{\partial z}}\right]_{0}+{\frac {1}{2}}\,\eta ^{2}\,\left[{\frac {\partial ^{2}f}{\partial z^{2}}}\right]_{0}+\cdots } with subscript zero meaning evaluation at z = 0 , e.g.: [ f ] 0 = f ( x , y ,0, t ) . Applying the Taylor expansion to free-surface boundary condition Eq. (E) in terms of the potential Φ gives: [49] [52] [ ∂ 2 Φ ∂ t 2 + g ∂ Φ ∂ z ] 0 + η [ ∂ ∂ z ( ∂ 2 Φ ∂ t 2 + g ∂ Φ ∂ z ) ] 0 + [ ∂ ∂ t ( | u | 2 ) ] 0 + 1 2 η 2 [ ∂ 2 ∂ z 2 ( ∂ 2 Φ ∂ t 2 + g ∂ Φ ∂ z ) ] 0 + η [ ∂ 2 ∂ t ∂ z ( | u | 2 ) ] 0 + [ 1 2 u ⋅ ∇ ( | u | 2 ) ] 0 + ⋯ = 0 , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&\left[{\frac {\partial ^{2}\Phi }{\partial t^{2}}}+g\,{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial z}}\right]_{0}+\eta \left[{\frac {\partial }{\partial z}}\left({\frac {\partial ^{2}\Phi }{\partial t^{2}}}+g\,{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial z}}\right)\right]_{0}+\left[{\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}\left(|\mathbf {u} |^{2}\right)\right]_{0}\\&\quad +{\tfrac {1}{2}}\,\eta ^{2}\left[{\frac {\partial ^{2}}{\partial z^{2}}}\left({\frac {\partial ^{2}\Phi }{\partial t^{2}}}+g\,{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial z}}\right)\right]_{0}+\eta \left[{\frac {\partial ^{2}}{\partial t\,\partial z}}\left(|\mathbf {u} |^{2}\right)\right]_{0}+\left[{\tfrac {1}{2}}\,\mathbf {u} \cdot {\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\left(|\mathbf {u} |^{2}\right)\right]_{0}\\&\quad +\cdots =0,\end{aligned}}} ( G ) showing terms up to triple products of η , Φ and u , as required for the construction of the Stokes expansion up to third-order O (( ka ) 3 ). Here, ka is the wave steepness, with k a characteristic wavenumber and a a characteristic wave amplitude for the problem under study. The fields η , Φ and u are assumed to be O ( ka ). The dynamic free-surface boundary condition Eq. (D) can be evaluated in terms of quantities at z = 0 as: [49] [52] [ ∂ Φ ∂ t + g η ] 0 + η [ ∂ 2 Φ ∂ t ∂ z ] 0 + [ 1 2 | u | 2 ] 0 + 1 2 η 2 [ ∂ 3 Φ ∂ t ∂ z 2 ] 0 + η [ ∂ ∂ z ( 1 2 | u | 2 ) ] 0 + ⋯ = 0. {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&\left[{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial t}}+g\,\eta \right]_{0}+\eta \left[{\frac {\partial ^{2}\Phi }{\partial t\,\partial z}}\right]_{0}+{\biggl [}{\tfrac {1}{2}}\,\left|\mathbf {u} \right|^{2}{\biggr ]}_{0}\\&\quad +{\tfrac {1}{2}}\,\eta ^{2}\left[{\frac {\partial ^{3}\Phi }{\partial t\,\partial z^{2}}}\right]_{0}+\eta \left[{\frac {\partial }{\partial z}}\left({\tfrac {1}{2}}\,\left|\mathbf {u} \right|^{2}\right)\right]_{0}+\cdots =0.\end{aligned}}} ( H ) The advantages of these Taylor-series expansions fully emerge in combination with a perturbation-series approach, for weakly non-linear waves ( ka ≪ 1) . Perturbation-series approach [ edit ] The perturbation series are in terms of a small ordering parameter ε ≪ 1 – which subsequently turns out to be proportional to (and of the order of) the wave slope ka , see the series solution in this section . [53] So, take ε = ka : η = ε η 1 + ε 2 η 2 + ε 3 η 3 + ⋯ , Φ = ε Φ 1 + ε 2 Φ 2 + ε 3 Φ 3 + ⋯ and u = ε u 1 + ε 2 u 2 + ε 3 u 3 + ⋯ . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\eta &=\varepsilon \,\eta _{1}+\varepsilon ^{2}\,\eta _{2}+\varepsilon ^{3}\,\eta _{3}+\cdots ,\\\Phi &=\varepsilon \,\Phi _{1}+\varepsilon ^{2}\,\Phi _{2}+\varepsilon ^{3}\,\Phi _{3}+\cdots \quad {\text{and}}\\\mathbf {u} &=\varepsilon \,\mathbf {u} _{1}+\varepsilon ^{2}\,\mathbf {u} _{2}+\varepsilon ^{3}\,\mathbf {u} _{3}+\cdots .\end{aligned}}} When applied in the flow equations, they should be valid independent of the particular value of ε . By equating in powers of ε , each term proportional to ε to a certain power has to equal to zero. As an example of how the perturbation-series approach works, consider the non-linear boundary condition (G) ; it becomes: [6] ε { ∂ 2 Φ 1 ∂ t 2 + g ∂ Φ 1 ∂ z } + ε 2 { ∂ 2 Φ 2 ∂ t 2 + g ∂ Φ 2 ∂ z + η

the water depth, for three successive wave periods . The wave height is about 9.2% of the wavelength . Description of the animation : The white dots are fluid particles, followed in time. In the case shown here, the mean Eulerian horizontal velocity below the wave trough is zero. [54] The waves of permanent form propagate with a constant phase velocity (or celerity ), denoted as c . If the steady wave motion is in the horizontal x -direction, the flow quantities η and u are not separately dependent on x and time t , but are functions of x − ct : [55] η ( x , t ) = η ( x − c t ) and u ( x , z , t ) = u ( x − c t , z ) . {\displaystyle \eta (x,t)=\eta (x-ct)\quad {\text{and}}\quad \mathbf {u} (x,z,t)=\mathbf {u} (x-ct,z).} Further the waves are periodic – and because they are also of permanent form – both in horizontal space x and in time t , with wavelength λ and period τ respectively. Note that Φ ( x , z , t ) itself is not necessary periodic due to the possibility of a constant (linear) drift in x and/or t : [56] Φ ( x , z , t ) = β x − γ t + φ ( x − c t , z ) , {\displaystyle \Phi (x,z,t)=\beta x-\gamma t+\varphi (x-ct,z),} with φ ( x , z , t ) – as well as the derivatives ∂ Φ /∂ t and ∂ Φ /∂ x – being periodic. Here β is the mean flow velocity below trough level, and γ is related to the hydraulic head as observed in a frame of reference moving with the wave's phase velocity c (so the flow becomes steady in this reference frame). In order to apply the Stokes expansion to progressive periodic waves, it is advantageous to describe them through Fourier series as a function of the wave phase θ ( x , t ): [48] [56] θ = k x − ω t = k ( x − c t ) , {\displaystyle \theta =kx-\omega t=k\left(x-ct\right),} assuming waves propagating in the x –direction. Here k = 2 π / λ is the wavenumber , ω = 2 π / τ is the angular frequency and c = ω / k (= λ / τ ) is the phase velocity . Now, the free surface elevation η ( x , t ) of a periodic wave can be described as the Fourier series : [11] [56] η = ∑ n = 1 ∞ A n cos ( n θ ) . {\displaystyle \eta =\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }A_{n}\,\cos \,(n\theta ).} Similarly, the corresponding expression for the velocity potential Φ ( x , z , t ) is: [56] Φ = β x − γ t + ∑ n = 1 ∞ B n [ cosh ( n k ( z + h ) ) ] sin ( n θ ) , {\displaystyle \Phi =\beta x-\gamma t+\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }B_{n}\,{\biggl [}\cosh \,\left(nk\,(z+h)\right){\biggr ]}\,\sin \,(n\theta ),} satisfying both the Laplace equation ∇ 2 Φ = 0 in the fluid interior, as well as the boundary condition ∂ Φ /∂ z = 0 at the bed z = − h . For a given value of the wavenumber k , the parameters: A n , B n (with n = 1, 2, 3, ... ), c , β and γ have yet to be determined. They all can be expanded as perturbation series in ε . Fenton (1990) provides these values for fifth-order Stokes's wave theory. For progressive periodic waves, derivatives with respect to x and t of functions f ( θ , z ) of θ ( x , t ) can be expressed as derivatives with respect to θ : ∂ f ∂ x = + k ∂ f ∂ θ and ∂ f ∂ t = − ω ∂ f ∂ θ . {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}=+k\,{\frac {\partial f}{\partial \theta }}\qquad {\text{and}}\qquad {\frac {\partial f}{\partial t}}=-\omega \,{\frac {\partial f}{\partial \theta }}.} The important point for non-linear waves – in contrast to linear Airy wave theory – is that the phase velocity c also depends on the wave amplitude a , besides its dependence on wavelength λ = 2π / k and mean depth h . Negligence of the dependence of c on wave amplitude results in the appearance of secular terms , in the higher-order contributions to the perturbation-series solution. Stokes (1847) already applied the required non-linear correction to the phase speed c in order to prevent secular behaviour. A general approach to do so is now known as the Lindstedt–Poincaré method . Since the wavenumber k is given and thus fixed, the non-linear behaviour of the phase velocity c = ω / k is brought into account by also expanding the angular frequency ω into a perturbation series: [9] ω = ω 0 + ε ω 1 + ε 2 ω 2 + ⋯ . {\displaystyle \omega =\omega _{0}+\varepsilon \,\omega _{1}+\varepsilon ^{2}\,\omega _{2}+\cdots .} Here ω 0 will turn out to be related to the wavenumber k through the linear dispersion relation . However time derivatives, through ∂ f /∂ t = − ω ∂ f /∂ θ , now also give contributions – containing ω 1 , ω 2 , etc. – to the governing equations at higher orders in the perturbation series. By tuning ω 1 , ω 2 , etc., secular behaviour can be prevented. For surface gravity waves, it is found that ω 1 = 0 and the first non-zero contribution to the dispersion relation comes from ω 2 (see e.g. the sub-section "" Third-order dispersion relation "" above). [9] Stokes's two definitions of wave celerity [ edit ] For non-linear surface waves there is, in general, ambiguity in splitting the total motion into a wave part and a mean part. As a consequence, there is some freedom in choosing the phase speed (celerity) of the wave. Stokes (1847) identified two logical definitions of phase speed, known as Stokes's first and second definition of wave celerity: [6] [11] [57] Stokes's first definition of wave celerity has, for a pure wave motion, the mean value of the horizontal Eulerian flow-velocity Ū E at any location below trough level equal to zero. Due to the irrotationality of potential flow, together with the horizontal sea bed and periodicity the mean horizontal velocity, the mean horizontal velocity is a constant between bed and trough level. So in Stokes first definition the wave is considered from a frame of reference moving with the mean horizontal velocity Ū E . This is an advantageous approach when the mean Eulerian flow velocity Ū E is known, e.g. from measurements. Stokes's second definition of wave celerity is for a frame of reference where the mean horizontal mass transport of the wave motion equal to zero. This is different from the first definition due to the mass transport in the splash zone , i.e. between the trough and crest level, in the wave propagation direction. This wave-induced mass transport is caused by the positive correlation between surface elevation and horizontal velocity. In the reference frame for Stokes's second definition, the wave-induced mass transport is compensated by an opposing undertow (so Ū E < 0 for waves propagating in the positive x -direction). This is the logical definition for waves generated in a wave flume in the laboratory, or waves moving perpendicular towards a beach. As pointed out by Michael E. McIntyre , the mean horizontal mass transport will be (near) zero for a wave group approaching into still water, with also in deep water the mass transport caused by the waves balanced by an opposite mass transport in a return flow (undertow). [58] This is due to the fact that otherwise a large mean force will be needed to accelerate the body of water into which the wave group is propagating.

In deep(er) water, the characteristic wavelength is the only length scale available. So, the horizontal and vertical coordinates are all non-dimensionalized with the wavelength. This leads to Stokes wave theory. However, in shallow water, the water depth is the appropriate characteristic scale to make the vertical coordinate non-dimensional, while the horizontal coordinates are scaled with the wavelength – resulting in the Boussinesq approximation .

It measures approximately 62.74 kilometres (38.98 mi) in diameter and was named after Irish-born physicist George Gabriel Stokes (1819–1903). The crater's name was officially adopted by IAU's Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature in 1973. [1] It is distinctive for its dark-toned sand dunes, which have been formed by the planet's strong winds. Research released in July 2010 showed that is one of at least nine craters in the northern lowlands that contains hydrated minerals. They are clay minerals, also called phyllosilicates.

Stokes' theorem , [1] also known as the Kelvin–Stokes theorem [2] [3] after Lord Kelvin and George Stokes , the fundamental theorem for curls or simply the curl theorem , [4] is a theorem in vector calculus on R 3 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}} . Given a vector field , the theorem relates the integral of the curl of the vector field over some surface, to the line integral of the vector field around the boundary of the surface. The classical theorem of Stokes can be stated in one sentence: The line integral of a vector field over a loop is equal to the surface integral of its curl over the enclosed surface. It is illustrated in the figure, where the direction of positive circulation of the bounding contour ∂Σ , and the direction n of positive flux through the surface Σ , are related by a right-hand-rule. For the right hand the fingers circulate along ∂Σ and the thumb is directed along n . Stokes' theorem is a special case of the generalized Stokes theorem . [5] [6] In particular, a vector field on R 3 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}} can be considered as a 1-form in which case its curl is its exterior derivative , a 2-form. Theorem [ edit ] Let Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } be a smooth oriented surface in R 3 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}} with boundary ∂ Σ ≡ Γ {\displaystyle \partial \Sigma \equiv \Gamma } . If a vector field F ( x , y , z ) = ( F x ( x , y , z ) , F y ( x , y , z ) , F z ( x , y , z ) ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} (x,y,z)=(F_{x}(x,y,z),F_{y}(x,y,z),F_{z}(x,y,z))} is defined and has continuous first order partial derivatives in a region containing Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } , then ∬ Σ ( ∇ × F ) ⋅ d Σ = ∮ ∂ Σ F ⋅ d Γ . {\displaystyle \iint _{\Sigma }(\nabla \times \mathbf {F} )\cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {\Sigma } =\oint _{\partial \Sigma }\mathbf {F} \cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {\Gamma } .} More explicitly, the equality says that ∬ Σ ( ( ∂ F z ∂ y − ∂ F y ∂ z ) d y d z + ( ∂ F x ∂ z − ∂ F z ∂ x ) d z d x + ( ∂ F y ∂ x − ∂ F x ∂ y ) d x d y ) = ∮ ∂ Σ ( F x d x + F y d y + F z d z ) . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&\iint _{\Sigma }\left(\left({\frac {\partial F_{z}}{\partial y}}-{\frac {\partial F_{y}}{\partial z}}\right)\,\mathrm {d} y\,\mathrm {d} z+\left({\frac {\partial F_{x}}{\partial z}}-{\frac {\partial F_{z}}{\partial x}}\right)\,\mathrm {d} z\,\mathrm {d} x+\left({\frac {\partial F_{y}}{\partial x}}-{\frac {\partial F_{x}}{\partial y}}\right)\,\mathrm {d} x\,\mathrm {d} y\right)\\&=\oint _{\partial \Sigma }{\Bigl (}F_{x}\,\mathrm {d} x+F_{y}\,\mathrm {d} y+F_{z}\,\mathrm {d} z{\Bigr )}.\end{aligned}}} The main challenge in a precise statement of Stokes' theorem is in defining the notion of a boundary. Surfaces such as the Koch snowflake , for example, are well-known not to exhibit a Riemann-integrable boundary, and the notion of surface measure in Lebesgue theory cannot be defined for a non- Lipschitz surface. One (advanced) technique is to pass to a weak formulation and then apply the machinery of geometric measure theory ; for that approach see the coarea formula . In this article, we instead use a more elementary definition, based on the fact that a boundary can be discerned for full-dimensional subsets of R 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}} . A more detailed statement will be given for subsequent discussions. Let γ : [ a , b ] → R 2 {\displaystyle \gamma :[a,b]\to \mathbb {R} ^{2}} be a piecewise smooth Jordan plane curve . The Jordan curve theorem implies that γ {\displaystyle \gamma } divides R 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}} into two components, a compact one and another that is non-compact. Let D {\displaystyle D} denote the compact part; then D {\displaystyle D} is bounded by γ {\displaystyle \gamma } . It now suffices to transfer this notion of boundary along a continuous map to our surface in R 3 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}} . But we already have such a map: the parametrization of Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } . Suppose ψ : D → R 3 {\displaystyle \psi :D\to \mathbb {R} ^{3}} is piecewise smooth at the neighborhood of D {\displaystyle D} , with Σ = ψ ( D ) {\displaystyle \Sigma =\psi (D)} . [note 1] If Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } is the space curve defined by Γ ( t ) = ψ ( γ ( t ) ) {\displaystyle \Gamma (t)=\psi (\gamma (t))} [note 2] then we call Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } the boundary of Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } , written ∂ Σ {\displaystyle \partial \Sigma } . With the above notation, if F {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} } is any smooth vector field on R 3 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}} , then [7] [8] ∮ ∂ Σ F ⋅ d Γ = ∬ Σ ∇ × F ⋅ d Σ . {\displaystyle \oint _{\partial \Sigma }\mathbf {F} \,\cdot \,\mathrm {d} {\mathbf {\Gamma } }=\iint _{\Sigma }\nabla \times \mathbf {F} \,\cdot \,\mathrm {d} \mathbf {\Sigma } .} Here, the "" ⋅ {\displaystyle \cdot } "" represents the dot product in R 3 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}} . Proof [ edit ] The proof of the theorem consists of 4 steps. We assume Green's theorem , so what is of concern is how to boil down the three-dimensional complicated problem (Stokes' theorem) to a two-dimensional rudimentary problem (Green's theorem). [9] When proving this theorem, mathematicians normally deduce it as a special case of a more general result , which is stated in terms of differential forms , and proved using more sophisticated machinery. While powerful, these techniques require substantial background, so the proof below avoids them, and does not presuppose any knowledge beyond a familiarity with basic vector calculus and linear algebra. [8] At the end of this section, a short alternative proof of Stokes' theorem is given, as a corollary of the generalized Stokes' theorem. Elementary proof [ edit ] First step of the elementary proof (parametrization of integral) [ edit ] As in § Theorem , we reduce the dimension by using the natural parametrization of the surface. Let ψ and γ be as in that section, and note that by change of variables ∮ ∂ Σ F ( x ) ⋅ d Γ = ∮ γ F ( ψ ( γ ) ) ⋅ d ψ ( γ ) = ∮ γ F ( ψ ( y ) ) ⋅ J y ( ψ ) d γ {\displaystyle \oint _{\partial \Sigma }{\mathbf {F} (\mathbf {x} )\cdot \,\mathrm {d} \mathbf {\Gamma } }=\oint _{\gamma }{\mathbf {F} ({\boldsymbol {\psi }}(\mathbf {\gamma } ))\cdot \,\mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {\psi }}(\mathbf {\gamma } )}=\oint _{\gamma }{\mathbf {F} ({\boldsymbol {\psi }}(\mathbf {y} ))\cdot J_{\mathbf {y} }({\boldsymbol {\psi }})\,\mathrm {d} \gamma }} where J y ψ stands for the Jacobian matrix of ψ at y = γ ( t ) . Now let { e u , e v } be an orthonormal basis in the coordinate directions of R 2 . [note 3] Recognizing that the columns of J y ψ are precisely the partial derivatives of ψ at y , we can expand the previous equation in coordinates as ∮ ∂ Σ F ( x ) ⋅ d Γ = ∮ γ F ( ψ ( y ) ) J y ( ψ ) e u ( e u ⋅ d y ) + F ( ψ ( y ) ) J y ( ψ ) e v ( e v ⋅ d y ) = ∮ γ ( ( F ( ψ ( y ) ) ⋅ ∂ ψ ∂ u ( y ) ) e u + ( F ( ψ ( y ) ) ⋅ ∂ ψ ∂ v ( y ) ) e v ) ⋅ d y {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\oint _{\partial \Sigma }{\mathbf {F} (\mathbf {x} )\cdot \,\mathrm {d} \mathbf {\Gamma } }&=\oint _{\gamma }{\mathbf {F} ({\boldsymbol {\psi }}(\mathbf {y} ))J_{\mathbf {y} }({\boldsymbol {\psi }})\mathbf {e} _{u}(\mathbf {e} _{u}\cdot \,\mathrm {d} \mathbf {y} )+\mathbf {F} ({\boldsymbol {\psi }}(\mathbf {y} ))J_{\mathbf {y} }({\boldsymbol {\psi }})\mathbf {e} _{v}(\mathbf {e} _{v}\cdot \,\mathrm {d} \mathbf {y} )}\\&=\oint _{\gamma }{\left(\left(\mathbf {F} ({\boldsymbol {\psi }}(\mathbf {y} ))\cdot {\frac {\partial {\boldsymbol {\psi }}}{\partial u}}(\mathbf {y} )\right)\mathbf {e} _{u}+\left(\mathbf {F} ({\boldsymbol {\psi }}(\mathbf {y} ))\cdot {\frac {\partial {\boldsymbol {\psi }}}{\partial v}}(\mathbf {y} )\right)\mathbf {e} _{v}\right)\cdot \,\mathrm {d} \mathbf {y} }\end{aligned}}} Second step in the elementary proof (defining the pullback) [ edit ] The previous step suggests we define the function P ( u , v ) = ( F ( ψ ( u , v ) ) ⋅ ∂ ψ ∂ u ( u , v ) ) e u + ( F ( ψ ( u , v ) ) ⋅ ∂ ψ ∂ v ( u , v ) ) e v {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} (u,v)=\left(\mathbf {F} ({\boldsymbol {\psi }}(u,v))\cdot {\frac {\partial {\boldsymbol {\psi }}}{\partial u}}(u,v)\right)\mathbf {e} _{u}+\left(\mathbf {F} ({\boldsymbol {\psi }}(u,v))\cdot {\frac {\partial {\boldsymbol {\psi }}}{\partial v}}(u,v)\right)\mathbf {e} _{v}} Now, if the scalar value functions P u {\displaystyle P_{u}} and P v {\displaystyle P_{v}} are defined as follows, P u ( u , v ) = ( F ( ψ ( u , v ) ) ⋅ ∂ ψ ∂ u ( u , v ) ) {\displaystyle {P_{u}}(u,v)=\left(\mathbf {F} ({\boldsymbol {\psi }}(u,v))\cdot {\frac {\partial {\boldsymbol {\psi }}}{\partial u}}(u,v)\right)} P v ( u , v ) = ( F ( ψ ( u , v ) ) ⋅ ∂ ψ ∂ v ( u , v ) ) {\displaystyle {P_{v}}(u,v)=\left(\mathbf {F} ({\boldsymbol {\psi }}(u,v))\cdot {\frac {\partial {\boldsymbol {\psi }}}{\partial v}}(u,v)\right)} then, P ( u , v ) = P u ( u , v ) e u + P v ( u , v ) e v . {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} (u,v)={P_{u}}(u,v)\mathbf {e} _{u}+{P_{v}}(u,v)\mathbf {e} _{v}.} This is the pullback of F along ψ , and, by the above, it satisfies ∮ ∂ Σ F ( x ) ⋅ d l = ∮ γ P ( y ) ⋅ d l = ∮ γ ( P u ( u , v ) e u + P v ( u , v ) e v ) ⋅ d l {\displaystyle \oint _{\partial \Sigma }{\mathbf {F} (\mathbf {x} )\cdot \,\mathrm {d} \mathbf {l} }=\oint _{\gamma }{\mathbf {P} (\mathbf {y} )\cdot \,\mathrm {d} \mathbf {l} }=\oint _{\gamma }{({P_{u}}(u,v)\mathbf {e} _{u}+{P_{v}}(u,v)\mathbf {e} _{v})\cdot \,\mathrm {d} \mathbf {l} }} We have successfully reduced one side of Stokes' theorem to a 2-dimensional formula; we now turn to the other side. Third step of the elementary proof (second equation) [ edit ] First, calculate the partial derivatives appearing in Green's theorem , via the product rule : ∂ P u ∂ v = ∂ ( F ∘ ψ ) ∂ v ⋅ ∂ ψ ∂ u + ( F ∘ ψ ) ⋅ ∂ 2 ψ ∂ v ∂ u ∂ P v ∂ u = ∂ ( F ∘ ψ ) ∂ u ⋅ ∂ ψ ∂ v + ( F ∘ ψ ) ⋅ ∂ 2 ψ ∂ u ∂ v {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\partial P_{u}}{\partial v}}&={\frac {\partial (\mathbf {F} \circ {\boldsymbol {\psi }})}{\partial v}}\cdot {\frac {\partial {\boldsymbol {\psi }}}{\partial u}}+(\mathbf {F} \circ {\boldsymbol {\psi }})\cdot {\frac {\partial ^{2}{\boldsymbol {\psi }}}{\partial v\,\partial u}}\\[5pt]{\frac {\partial P_{v}}{\partial u}}&={\frac {\partial (\mathbf {F} \circ {\boldsymbol {\psi }})}{\partial u}}\cdot {\frac {\partial {\boldsymbol {\psi }}}{\partial v}}+(\mathbf {F} \circ {\boldsymbol {\psi }})\cdot {\frac {\partial ^{2}{\boldsymbol {\psi }}}{\partial u\,\partial v}}\end{aligned}}} Conveniently, the second term vanishes in the difference, by equality of mixed partials . So, [note 4] ∂ P v ∂ u − ∂ P u ∂ v = ∂ ( F ∘ ψ ) ∂ u ⋅ ∂ ψ ∂ v − ∂ ( F ∘ ψ ) ∂ v ⋅ ∂ ψ ∂ u = ∂ ψ ∂ v ⋅ ( J ψ ( u , v ) F ) ∂ ψ ∂ u − ∂ ψ ∂ u ⋅ ( J ψ ( u , v ) F ) ∂ ψ ∂ v (chain rule) = ∂ ψ ∂ v ⋅ ( J ψ ( u , v ) F − ( J ψ ( u , v ) F ) T ) ∂ ψ ∂ u {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\partial P_{v}}{\partial u}}-{\frac {\partial P_{u}}{\partial v}}&={\frac {\partial (\mathbf {F} \circ {\boldsymbol {\psi }})}{\partial u}}\cdot {\frac {\partial {\boldsymbol {\psi }}}{\partial v}}-{\frac {\partial (\mathbf {F} \circ {\boldsymbol {\psi }})}{\partial v}}\cdot {\frac {\partial {\boldsymbol {\psi }}}{\partial u}}\\[5pt]&={\frac {\partial {\boldsymbol {\psi }}}{\partial v}}\cdot (J_{{\boldsymbol {\psi }}(u,v)}\mathbf {F} ){\frac {\partial {\boldsymbol {\psi }}}{\partial u}}-{\frac {\partial {\boldsymbol {\psi }}}{\partial u}}\cdot (J_{{\boldsymbol {\psi }}(u,v)}\mathbf {F} ){\frac {\partial {\boldsymbol {\psi }}}{\partial v}}&&{\text{(chain rule)}}\\[5pt]&={\frac {\partial {\boldsymbol {\psi }}}{\partial v}}\cdot \left(J_{{\boldsymbol {\psi }}(u,v)}\mathbf {F} -{(J_{{\boldsymbol {\psi }}(u,v)}\mathbf {F} )}^{\mathsf {T}}\right){\frac {\partial {\boldsymbol {\psi }}}{\partial u}}\end{aligned}}} But now consider the matrix in that quadratic form—that is, J ψ ( u , v ) F − ( J ψ ( u , v ) F ) T {\displaystyle J_{{\boldsymbol {\psi }}(u,v)}\mathbf {F} -(J_{{\boldsymbol {\psi }}(u,v)}\mathbf {F} )^{\mathsf {T}}} . We claim this matrix in fact describes a cross product. Here the superscript "" T {\displaystyle {}^{\mathsf {T}}} "" represents the transposition of matrices . To be precise, let A = ( A i j ) i j {\displaystyle A=(A_{ij})_{ij}} be an arbitrary 3 × 3 matrix and let a = [ a 1 a 2 a 3 ] = [ A 32 − A 23 A 13 − A 31 A 21 − A 12 ] {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} ={\begin{bmatrix}a_{1}\\a_{2}\\a_{3}\end{bmatrix}}={\begin{bmatrix}A_{32}-A_{23}\\A_{13}-A_{31}\\A_{21}-A_{12}\end{bmatrix}}} Note that x ↦ a × x is linear, so it is determined by its action on basis elements. But by direct calculation ( A − A T ) e 1 = [ 0 a 3 − a 2 ] = a × e 1 ( A − A T ) e 2 = [ − a 3 0 a 1 ] = a × e 2 ( A − A T ) e 3 = [ a 2 − a 1 0 ] = a × e 3 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\left(A-A^{\mathsf {T}}\right)\mathbf {e} _{1}&={\begin{bmatrix}0\\a_{3}\\-a_{2}\end{bmatrix}}=\mathbf {a} \times \mathbf {e} _{1}\\\left(A-A^{\mathsf {T}}\right)\mathbf {e} _{2}&={\begin{bmatrix}-a_{3}\\0\\a_{1}\end{bmatrix}}=\mathbf {a} \times \mathbf {e} _{2}\\\left(A-A^{\mathsf {T}}\right)\mathbf {e} _{3}&={\begin{bmatrix}a_{2}\\-a_{1}\\0\end{bmatrix}}=\mathbf {a} \times \mathbf {e} _{3}\end{aligned}}} Here, { e 1 , e 2 , e 3 } represents an orthonormal basis in the coordinate directions of R 3 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}} . [note 5] Thus ( A − A T ) x = a × x for any x . Substituting ( J ψ ( u , v ) F ) {\displaystyle {(J_{{\boldsymbol {\psi }}(u,v)}\mathbf {F} )}} for A , we obtain ( ( J ψ ( u , v ) F ) − ( J ψ ( u , v ) F ) T ) x = ( ∇ × F ) × x , for all x ∈ R 3 {\displaystyle \left({(J_{{\boldsymbol {\psi }}(u,v)}\mathbf {F} )}-{(J_{{\boldsymbol {\psi }}(u,v)}\mathbf {F} )}^{\mathsf {T}}\right)\mathbf {x} =(\nabla \times \mathbf {F} )\times \mathbf {x} ,\quad {\text{for all}}\,\mathbf {x} \in \mathbb {R} ^{3}} We can now recognize the difference of partials as a (scalar) triple product : ∂ P v ∂ u − ∂ P u ∂ v = ∂ ψ ∂ v ⋅ ( ∇ × F ) × ∂ ψ ∂ u = ( ∇ × F ) ⋅ ∂ ψ ∂ u × ∂ ψ ∂ v {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\partial P_{v}}{\partial u}}-{\frac {\partial P_{u}}{\partial v}}&={\frac {\partial {\boldsymbol {\psi }}}{\partial v}}\cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf {F} )\times {\frac {\partial {\boldsymbol {\psi }}}{\partial u}}=(\nabla \times \mathbf {F} )\cdot {\frac {\partial {\boldsymbol {\psi }}}{\partial u}}\times {\frac {\partial {\boldsymbol {\psi }}}{\partial v}}\end{aligned}}} On the other hand, the definition of a surface integral also includes a triple product—the very same one! ∬ Σ ( ∇ × F ) ⋅ d Σ = ∬ D ( ∇ × F ) ( ψ ( u , v ) ) ⋅ ∂ ψ ∂ u ( u , v ) × ∂ ψ ∂ v ( u , v ) d u d v {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\iint _{\Sigma }(\nabla \times \mathbf {F} )\cdot \,d\mathbf {\Sigma } &=\iint _{D}{(\nabla \times \mathbf {F} )({\boldsymbol {\psi }}(u,v))\cdot {\frac {\partial {\boldsymbol {\psi }}}{\partial u}}(u,v)\times {\frac {\partial {\boldsymbol {\psi }}}{\partial v}}(u,v)\,\mathrm {d} u\,\mathrm {d} v}\end{aligned}}} So, we obtain ∬ Σ ( ∇ × F ) ⋅ d Σ = ∬ D ( ∂ P v ∂ u − ∂ P u ∂ v ) d u d v {\displaystyle \iint _{\Sigma }(\nabla \times \mathbf {F} )\cdot \,\mathrm {d} \mathbf {\Sigma } =\iint _{D}\left({\frac {\partial P_{v}}{\partial u}}-{\frac {\partial P_{u}}{\partial v}}\right)\,\mathrm {d} u\,\mathrm {d} v} Fourth step of the elementary proof (reduction to Green's theorem) [ edit ] Combining the second and third steps, and then applying Green's theorem completes the proof. Green's theorem asserts the following: for any region D bounded by the Jordans closed curve γ and two scalar-valued smooth functions P u ( u , v ) , P v ( u , v ) {\displaystyle P_{u}(u,v),P_{v}(u,v)} defined on D; ∮ γ ( P u ( u , v ) e u + P v ( u , v ) e v ) ⋅ d l = ∬ D ( ∂ P v ∂ u − ∂ P u ∂ v ) d u d v {\displaystyle \oint _{\gamma }{({P_{u}}(u,v)\mathbf {e} _{u}+{P_{v}}(u,v)\mathbf {e} _{v})\cdot \,\mathrm {d} \mathbf {l} }=\iint _{D}\left({\frac {\partial P_{v}}{\partial u}}-{\frac {\partial P_{u}}{\partial v}}\right)\,\mathrm {d} u\,\mathrm {d} v} We can substitute the conclusion of STEP2 into the left-hand side of Green's theorem above, and substitute the conclusion of STEP3 into the right-hand side. Q.E.D. Proof via differential forms [ edit ] The functions R 3 → R 3 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}\to \mathbb {R} ^{3}} can be identified with the differential 1-forms on R 3 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}} via the map F x e 1 + F y e 2 + F z e 3 ↦ F x d x + F y d y + F z d z . {\displaystyle F_{x}\mathbf {e} _{1}+F_{y}\mathbf {e} _{2}+F_{z}\mathbf {e} _{3}\mapsto F_{x}\,\mathrm {d} x+F_{y}\,\mathrm {d} y+F_{z}\,\mathrm {d} z.} Write the differential 1-form associated to a function F as ω F . Then one can calculate that ⋆ ω ∇ × F = d ω F {\displaystyle \star \omega _{\nabla \times \mathbf {F} }=\mathrm {d} \omega _{\mathbf {F} }} where ★ is the Hodge star and d {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} } is the exterior derivative . Thus, by generalized Stokes' theorem, [10] ∮ ∂ Σ F ⋅ d γ = ∮ ∂ Σ ω F = ∫ Σ d ω F = ∫ Σ ⋆ ω ∇ × F = ∬ Σ ∇ × F ⋅ d Σ {\displaystyle \oint _{\partial \Sigma }{\mathbf {F} \cdot \,\mathrm {d} \mathbf {\gamma } }=\oint _{\partial \Sigma }{\omega _{\mathbf {F} }}=\int _{\Sigma }{\mathrm {d} \omega _{\mathbf {F} }}=\int _{\Sigma }{\star \omega _{\nabla \times \mathbf {F} }}=\iint _{\Sigma }{\nabla \times \mathbf {F} \cdot \,\mathrm {d} \mathbf {\Sigma } }} Applications [ edit ] Irrotational fields [ edit ] In this section, we will discuss the irrotational field ( lamellar vector field ) based on Stokes' theorem. Definition 2-1 (irrotational field). A smooth vector field F on an open U ⊆ R 3 {\displaystyle U\subseteq \mathbb {R} ^{3}} is irrotational ( lamellar vector field ) if ∇ × F = 0 . This concept is very fundamental in mechanics; as we'll prove later, if F is irrotational and the domain of F is simply connected , then F is a conservative vector field . Helmholtz's theorem [ edit ] In this section, we will introduce a theorem that is derived from Stokes' theorem and characterizes vortex-free vector fields. In classical mechanics and fluid dynamics it is called Helmholtz's theorem . Theorem 2-1 (Helmholtz's theorem in fluid dynamics). [5] [3] : 142 Let U ⊆ R 3 {\displaystyle U\subseteq \mathbb {R} ^{3}} be an open subset with a lamellar vector field F and let c 0 , c 1 : [0, 1] → U be piecewise smooth loops. If there is a function H : [0, 1] × [0, 1] → U such that [TLH0] H is piecewise smooth, [TLH1] H ( t , 0) = c 0 ( t ) for all t ∈ [0, 1] , [TLH2] H ( t , 1) = c 1 ( t ) for all t ∈ [0, 1] , [TLH3] H (0, s ) = H (1, s ) for all s ∈ [0, 1] . Then, ∫ c 0 F d c 0 = ∫ c 1 F d c 1 {\displaystyle \int _{c_{0}}\mathbf {F} \,\mathrm {d} c_{0}=\int _{c_{1}}\mathbf {F} \,\mathrm {d} c_{1}} Some textbooks such as Lawrence [5] call the relationship between c 0 and c 1 stated in theorem 2-1 as ""homotopic"" and the function H : [0, 1] × [0, 1] → U as ""homotopy between c 0 and c 1 "". However, ""homotopic"" or ""homotopy"" in above-mentioned sense are different (stronger than) typical definitions of ""homotopic"" or ""homotopy""; the latter omit condition [TLH3]. So from now on we refer to homotopy (homotope) in the sense of theorem 2-1 as a tubular homotopy (resp. tubular-homotopic) . [note 6] Proof of Helmholtz's theorem [ edit ] The definitions of γ 1 , ..., γ 4 In what follows, we abuse notation and use "" ⊕ {\displaystyle \oplus } "" for concatenation of paths in the fundamental groupoid and "" ⊖ {\displaystyle \ominus } "" for reversing the orientation of a path. Let D = [0, 1] × [0, 1] , and split ∂ D into four line segments γ j . γ 1 : [ 0 , 1 ] → D ; γ 1 ( t ) = ( t , 0 ) γ 2 : [ 0 , 1 ] → D ; γ 2 ( s ) = ( 1 , s ) γ 3 : [ 0 , 1 ] → D ; γ 3 ( t ) = ( 1 − t , 1 ) γ 4 : [ 0 , 1 ] → D ; γ 4 ( s ) = ( 0 , 1 − s ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\gamma _{1}:[0,1]\to D;\quad &\gamma _{1}(t)=(t,0)\\\gamma _{2}:[0,1]\to D;\quad &\gamma _{2}(s)=(1,s)\\\gamma _{3}:[0,1]\to D;\quad &\gamma _{3}(t)=(1-t,1)\\\gamma _{4}:[0,1]\to D;\quad &\gamma _{4}(s)=(0,1-s)\end{aligned}}} so that ∂ D = γ 1 ⊕ γ 2 ⊕ γ 3 ⊕ γ 4 {\displaystyle \partial D=\gamma _{1}\oplus \gamma _{2}\oplus \gamma _{3}\oplus \gamma _{4}} By our assumption that c 0 and c 1 are piecewise smooth homotopic, there is a piecewise smooth homotopy H : D → M Γ i ( t ) = H ( γ i ( t ) ) i = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 Γ ( t ) = H ( γ ( t ) ) = ( Γ 1 ⊕ Γ 2 ⊕ Γ 3 ⊕ Γ 4 ) ( t ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\Gamma _{i}(t)&=H(\gamma _{i}(t))&&i=1,2,3,4\\\Gamma (t)&=H(\gamma (t))=(\Gamma _{1}\oplus \Gamma _{2}\oplus \Gamma _{3}\oplus \Gamma _{4})(t)\end{aligned}}} Let S be the image of D under H . That ∬ S ∇ × F d S = ∮ Γ F d Γ {\displaystyle \iint _{S}\nabla \times \mathbf {F} \,\mathrm {d} S=\oint _{\Gamma }\mathbf {F} \,\mathrm {d} \Gamma } follows immediately from Stokes' theorem. F is lamellar, so the left side vanishes, i.e. 0 = ∮ Γ F d Γ = ∑ i = 1 4 ∮ Γ i F d Γ {\displaystyle 0=\oint _{\Gamma }\mathbf {F} \,\mathrm {d} \Gamma =\sum _{i=1}^{4}\oint _{\Gamma _{i}}\mathbf {F} \,\mathrm {d} \Gamma } As H is tubular(satisfying [TLH3]), Γ 2 = ⊖ Γ 4 {\displaystyle \Gamma _{2}=\ominus \Gamma _{4}} and Γ 2 = ⊖ Γ 4 {\displaystyle \Gamma _{2}=\ominus \Gamma _{4}} . Thus the line integrals along Γ 2 ( s ) and Γ 4 ( s ) cancel, leaving 0 = ∮ Γ 1 F d Γ + ∮ Γ 3 F d Γ {\displaystyle 0=\oint _{\Gamma _{1}}\mathbf {F} \,\mathrm {d} \Gamma +\oint _{\Gamma _{3}}\mathbf {F} \,\mathrm {d} \Gamma } On the other hand, c 1 = Γ 1 , c 3 = ⊖ Γ 3 {\displaystyle c_{3}=\ominus \Gamma _{3}} , so that the desired equality follows almost immediately. Conservative forces [ edit ] Above Helmholtz's theorem gives an explanation as to why the work done by a conservative force in changing an object's position is path independent. First, we introduce the Lemma 2-2, which is a corollary of and a special case of Helmholtz's theorem. Lemma 2-2. [5] [6] Let U ⊆ R 3 {\displaystyle U\subseteq \mathbb {R} ^{3}} be an open subset , with a Lamellar vector field F and a piecewise smooth loop c 0 : [0, 1] → U . Fix a point p ∈ U , if there is a homotopy H : [0, 1] × [0, 1] → U such that [SC0] H is piecewise smooth , [SC1] H ( t , 0) = c 0 ( t ) for all t ∈ [0, 1] , [SC2] H ( t , 1) = p for all t ∈ [0, 1] , [SC3] H (0, s ) = H (1, s ) = p for all s ∈ [0, 1] . Then, ∫ c 0 F d c 0 = 0 {\displaystyle \int _{c_{0}}\mathbf {F} \,\mathrm {d} c_{0}=0} Above Lemma 2-2 follows from theorem 2–1. In Lemma 2-2, the existence of H satisfying [SC0] to [SC3] is crucial;the question is whether such a homotopy can be taken for arbitrary loops. If U is simply connected, such H exists. The definition of simply connected space follows: Definition 2-2 (simply connected space). [5] [6] Let M ⊆ R n {\displaystyle M\subseteq \mathbb {R} ^{n}} be non-empty and path-connected . M is called simply connected if and only if for any continuous loop, c : [0, 1] → M there exists a continuous tubular homotopy H : [0, 1] × [0, 1] → M from c to a fixed point p ∈ c ; that is, [SC0'] H is continuous , [SC1] H ( t , 0) = c ( t ) for all t ∈ [0, 1] , [SC2] H ( t , 1) = p for all t ∈ [0, 1] , [SC3] H (0, s ) = H (1, s ) = p for all s ∈ [0, 1] . The claim that ""for a conservative force, the work done in changing an object's position is path independent"" might seem to follow immediately if the M is simply connected. However, recall that simple-connection only guarantees the existence of a continuous homotopy satisfying [SC1-3]; we seek a piecewise smooth homotopy satisfying those conditions instead. Fortunately, the gap in regularity is resolved by the Whitney's approximation theorem . [6] : 136, 421 [11] In other words, the possibility of finding a continuous homotopy, but not being able to integrate over it, is actually eliminated with the benefit of higher mathematics. We thus obtain the following theorem. Theorem 2-2. [5] [6] Let U ⊆ R 3 {\displaystyle U\subseteq \mathbb {R} ^{3}} be open and simply connected with an irrotational vector field F . For all piecewise smooth loops c : [0, 1] → U ∫ c 0 F d c 0 = 0 {\displaystyle \int _{c_{0}}\mathbf {F} \,\mathrm {d} c_{0}=0} Maxwell's equations [ edit ] See also: Maxwell's equations § Circulation and curl In the physics of electromagnetism , Stokes' theorem provides the justification for the equivalence of the differential form of the Maxwell–Faraday equation and the Maxwell–Ampère equation and the integral form of these equations. For Faraday's law, Stokes' theorem is applied to the electric field, E {\displaystyle \mathbf {E} } : ∮ ∂ Σ E ⋅ d l = ∬ Σ ∇ × E ⋅ d S . {\displaystyle \oint _{\partial \Sigma }\mathbf {E} \cdot \mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {l}}=\iint _{\Sigma }\mathbf {\nabla } \times \mathbf {E} \cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {S} .} For Ampère's law, Stokes' theorem is applied to the magnetic field, B {\displaystyle \mathbf {B} } : ∮ ∂ Σ B ⋅ d l = ∬ Σ ∇ × B ⋅ d S . {\displaystyle \oint _{\partial \Sigma }\mathbf {B} \cdot \mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {l}}=\iint _{\Sigma }\mathbf {\nabla } \times \mathbf {B} \cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {S} .} Notes [ edit ] ^ Σ = ψ ( D ) {\displaystyle \Sigma =\psi (D)} represents the image set of D {\displaystyle D} by ψ {\displaystyle \psi } ^ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } may not be a Jordan curve if the loop γ {\displaystyle \gamma } interacts poorly with ψ {\displaystyle \psi } . Nonetheless, Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } is always a loop , and topologically a connected sum of countably many Jordan curves, so that the integrals are well-defined. ^ In this article, e u = [ 1 0 ] , e v = [ 0 1 ] . {\displaystyle \mathbf {e} _{u}={\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix}},\mathbf {e} _{v}={\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}}.} Note that, in some textbooks on vector analysis, these are assigned to different things. For example, in some text book's notation, { e u , e v } can mean the following { t u , t v } respectively. In this article, however, these are two completely different things. t u = 1 h u ∂ φ ∂ u , t v = 1 h v ∂ φ ∂ v . {\displaystyle \mathbf {t} _{u}={\frac {1}{h_{u}}}{\frac {\partial \varphi }{\partial u}}\,,\mathbf {t} _{v}={\frac {1}{h_{v}}}{\frac {\partial \varphi }{\partial v}}.} Here, h u = ‖ ∂ φ ∂ u ‖ , h v = ‖ ∂ φ ∂ v ‖ , {\displaystyle h_{u}=\left\|{\frac {\partial \varphi }{\partial u}}\right\|,h_{v}=\left\|{\frac {\partial \varphi }{\partial v}}\right\|,} and the "" ‖ ⋅ ‖ {\displaystyle \|\cdot \|} "" represents Euclidean norm . ^ For all a , b ∈ R n {\displaystyle {\textbf {a}},{\textbf {b}}\in \mathbb {R} ^{n}} , for all A ; n × n {\displaystyle A;n\times n} square matrix , a ⋅ A b = a T A b {\displaystyle {\textbf {a}}\cdot A{\textbf {b}}={\textbf {a}}^{\mathsf {T}}A{\textbf {b}}} and therefore a ⋅ A b = b ⋅ A T a {\displaystyle {\textbf {a}}\cdot A{\textbf {b}}={\textbf {b}}\cdot A^{\mathsf {T}}{\textbf {a}}} . ^ In this article, e 1 = [ 1 0 0 ] , e 2 = [ 0 1 0 ] , e 3 = [ 0 0 1 ] . {\displaystyle \mathbf {e} _{1}={\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\\0\end{bmatrix}},\mathbf {e} _{2}={\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\\0\end{bmatrix}},\mathbf {e} _{3}={\begin{bmatrix}0\\0\\1\end{bmatrix}}.} Note that, in some textbooks on vector analysis, these are assigned to different things. ^ There do exist textbooks that use the terms ""homotopy"" and ""homotopic"" in the sense of Theorem 2-1. [5] Indeed, this is very convenient for the specific problem of conservative forces. However, both uses of homotopy appear sufficiently frequently that some sort of terminology is necessary to disambiguate, and the term ""tubular homotopy"" adopted here serves well enough for that end.

The more general form of the equation in the classical case is [6] D = μ k B T , {\displaystyle D=\mu \,k_{\text{B}}T,} where D is the diffusion coefficient ; μ is the ""mobility"", or the ratio of the particle's terminal drift velocity to an applied force , μ = v d / F ; k B is the Boltzmann constant ; T is the absolute temperature . This equation is an early example of a fluctuation-dissipation relation . [7] Note that the equation above describes the classical case and should be modified when quantum effects are relevant. Two frequently used important special forms of the relation are: Einstein–Smoluchowski equation , for diffusion of charged particles: [8] D = μ q k B T q {\displaystyle D={\frac {\mu _{q}\,k_{\text{B}}T}{q}}} Stokes–Einstein–Sutherland equation , for diffusion of spherical particles through a liquid with low Reynolds number : D = k B T 6 π η r {\displaystyle D={\frac {k_{\text{B}}T}{6\pi \,\eta \,r}}} Here q is the electrical charge of a particle; μ q is the electrical mobility of the charged particle; η is the dynamic viscosity ; r is the radius of the spherical particle. Special cases [ edit ] Electrical mobility equation (classical case) [ edit ] For a particle with electrical charge q , its electrical mobility μ q is related to its generalized mobility μ by the equation μ = μ q / q . The parameter μ q is the ratio of the particle's terminal drift velocity to an applied electric field . Hence, the equation in the case of a charged particle is given as D = μ q k B T q , {\displaystyle D={\frac {\mu _{q}\,k_{\text{B}}T}{q}},} where D {\displaystyle D} is the diffusion coefficient ( m 2 s − 1 {\displaystyle \mathrm {m^{2}s^{-1}} } ). μ q {\displaystyle \mu _{q}} is the electrical mobility ( m 2 V − 1 s − 1 {\displaystyle \mathrm {m^{2}V^{-1}s^{-1}} } ). q {\displaystyle q} is the electric charge of particle (C, coulombs) T {\displaystyle T} is the electron temperature or ion temperature in plasma (K). [9] If the temperature is given in volts , which is more common for plasma: D = μ q T Z , {\displaystyle D={\frac {\mu _{q}\,T}{Z}},} where Z {\displaystyle Z} is the charge number of particle (unitless) T {\displaystyle T} is electron temperature or ion temperature in plasma (V). Electrical mobility equation (quantum case) [ edit ] For the case of Fermi gas or a Fermi liquid , relevant for the electron mobility in normal metals like in the free electron model , Einstein relation should be modified: D = μ q E F q , {\displaystyle D={\frac {\mu _{q}\,E_{\mathrm {F} }}{q}},} where E F {\displaystyle E_{\mathrm {F} }} is Fermi energy . Stokes–Einstein–Sutherland equation [ edit ] In the limit of low Reynolds number , the mobility μ is the inverse of the drag coefficient ζ {\displaystyle \zeta } . A damping constant γ = ζ / m {\displaystyle \gamma =\zeta /m} is frequently used for the inverse momentum relaxation time (time needed for the inertia momentum to become negligible compared to the random momenta) of the diffusive object. For spherical particles of radius r , Stokes' law gives ζ = 6 π η r , {\displaystyle \zeta =6\pi \,\eta \,r,} where η {\displaystyle \eta } is the viscosity of the medium. Thus the Einstein–Smoluchowski relation results into the Stokes–Einstein–Sutherland relation D = k B T 6 π η r . {\displaystyle D={\frac {k_{\text{B}}T}{6\pi \,\eta \,r}}.} This has been applied for many years to estimating the self-diffusion coefficient in liquids, and a version consistent with isomorph theory has been confirmed by computer simulations of the Lennard-Jones system. [10] In the case of rotational diffusion , the friction is ζ r = 8 π η r 3 {\displaystyle \zeta _{\text{r}}=8\pi \eta r^{3}} , and the rotational diffusion constant D r {\displaystyle D_{\text{r}}} is D r = k B T 8 π η r 3 . {\displaystyle D_{\text{r}}={\frac {k_{\text{B}}T}{8\pi \,\eta \,r^{3}}}.} This is sometimes referred to as the Stokes–Einstein–Debye relation. Semiconductor [ edit ] In a semiconductor with an arbitrary density of states , i.e. a relation of the form p = p ( φ ) {\displaystyle p=p(\varphi )} between the density of holes or electrons p {\displaystyle p} and the corresponding quasi Fermi level (or electrochemical potential ) φ {\displaystyle \varphi } , the Einstein relation is [11] [12] D = μ q p q d p d φ , {\displaystyle D={\frac {\mu _{q}p}{q{\frac {dp}{d\varphi }}}},} where μ q {\displaystyle \mu _{q}} is the electrical mobility (see § Proof of the general case for a proof of this relation). An example assuming a parabolic dispersion relation for the density of states and the Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics , which is often used to describe inorganic semiconductor materials, one can compute (see density of states ): p ( φ ) = N 0 e q φ k B T , {\displaystyle p(\varphi )=N_{0}e^{\frac {q\varphi }{k_{\text{B}}T}},} where N 0 {\displaystyle N_{0}} is the total density of available energy states, which gives the simplified relation: D = μ q k B T q . {\displaystyle D=\mu _{q}{\frac {k_{\text{B}}T}{q}}.} Nernst–Einstein equation [ edit ] By replacing the diffusivities in the expressions of electric ionic mobilities of the cations and anions from the expressions of the equivalent conductivity of an electrolyte the Nernst–Einstein equation is derived: Λ e = z i 2 F 2 R T ( D + + D − ) . {\displaystyle \Lambda _{e}={\frac {z_{i}^{2}F^{2}}{RT}}(D_{+}+D_{-}).} were R is the gas constant . Proof of the general case [ edit ] The proof of the Einstein relation can be found in many references, for example see the work of Ryogo Kubo . [13] Suppose some fixed, external potential energy U {\displaystyle U} generates a conservative force F ( x ) = − ∇ U ( x ) {\displaystyle F(\mathbf {x} )=-\nabla U(\mathbf {x} )} (for example, an electric force) on a particle located at a given position x {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} } . We assume that the particle would respond by moving with velocity v ( x ) = μ ( x ) F ( x ) {\displaystyle v(\mathbf {x} )=\mu (\mathbf {x} )F(\mathbf {x} )} (see Drag (physics) ). Now assume that there are a large number of such particles, with local concentration ρ ( x ) {\displaystyle \rho (\mathbf {x} )} as a function of the position. After some time, equilibrium will be established: particles will pile up around the areas with lowest potential energy U {\displaystyle U} , but still will be spread out to some extent because of diffusion . At equilibrium, there is no net flow of particles: the tendency of particles to get pulled towards lower U {\displaystyle U} , called the drift current , perfectly balances the tendency of particles to spread out due to diffusion, called the diffusion current (see drift-diffusion equation ). The net flux of particles due to the drift current is J d r i f t ( x ) = μ ( x ) F ( x ) ρ ( x ) = − ρ ( x ) μ ( x ) ∇ U ( x ) , {\displaystyle \mathbf {J} _{\mathrm {drift} }(\mathbf {x} )=\mu (\mathbf {x} )F(\mathbf {x} )\rho (\mathbf {x} )=-\rho (\mathbf {x} )\mu (\mathbf {x} )\nabla U(\mathbf {x} ),} i.e., the number of particles flowing past a given position equals the particle concentration times the average velocity. The flow of particles due to the diffusion current is, by Fick's law , J d i f f u s i o n ( x ) = − D ( x ) ∇ ρ ( x ) , {\displaystyle \mathbf {J} _{\mathrm {diffusion} }(\mathbf {x} )=-D(\mathbf {x} )\nabla \rho (\mathbf {x} ),} where the minus sign means that particles flow from higher to lower concentration. Now consider the equilibrium condition. First, there is no net flow, i.e. J d r i f t + J d i f f u s i o n = 0 {\displaystyle \mathbf {J} _{\mathrm {drift} }+\mathbf {J} _{\mathrm {diffusion} }=0} . Second, for non-interacting point particles, the equilibrium density ρ {\displaystyle \rho } is solely a function of the local potential energy U {\displaystyle U} , i.e. if two locations have the same U {\displaystyle U} then they will also have the same ρ {\displaystyle \rho } (e.g. see Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics as discussed below.) That means, applying the chain rule , ∇ ρ = d ρ d U ∇ U . {\displaystyle \nabla \rho ={\frac {\mathrm {d} \rho }{\mathrm {d} U}}\nabla U.} Therefore, at equilibrium: 0 = J d r i f t + J d i f f u s i o n = − μ ρ ∇ U − D ∇ ρ = ( − μ ρ − D d ρ d U ) ∇ U . {\displaystyle 0=\mathbf {J} _{\mathrm {drift} }+\mathbf {J} _{\mathrm {diffusion} }=-\mu \rho \nabla U-D\nabla \rho =\left(-\mu \rho -D{\frac {\mathrm {d} \rho }{\mathrm {d} U}}\right)\nabla U.} As this expression holds at every position x {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} } , it implies the general form of the Einstein relation: D = − μ ρ d ρ d U . {\displaystyle D=-\mu {\frac {\rho }{\frac {\mathrm {d} \rho }{\mathrm {d} U}}}.} The relation between ρ {\displaystyle \rho } and U {\displaystyle U} for classical particles can be modeled through Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics ρ ( x ) = A e − U ( x ) k B T , {\displaystyle \rho (\mathbf {x} )=Ae^{-{\frac {U(\mathbf {x} )}{k_{\text{B}}T}}},} where A {\displaystyle A} is a constant related to the total number of particles. Therefore d ρ d U = − 1 k B T ρ . {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} \rho }{\mathrm {d} U}}=-{\frac {1}{k_{\text{B}}T}}\rho .} Under this assumption, plugging this equation into the general Einstein relation gives: D = − μ ρ d ρ d U = μ k B T , {\displaystyle D=-\mu {\frac {\rho }{\frac {\mathrm {d} \rho }{\mathrm {d} U}}}=\mu k_{\text{B}}T,} which corresponds to the classical Einstein relation.

[1] For liquids, it corresponds to the informal concept of ""thickness"": for example, syrup has a higher viscosity than water . [2] Viscosity is defined scientifically as a force multiplied by a time divided by an area. Thus its SI units are newton-seconds per square meter, or pascal-seconds. [1] Viscosity quantifies the internal frictional force between adjacent layers of fluid that are in relative motion. [1] For instance, when a viscous fluid is forced through a tube, it flows more quickly near the tube's axis than near its walls. [3] Experiments show that some stress (such as a pressure difference between the two ends of the tube) is needed to sustain the flow. This is because a force is required to overcome the friction between the layers of the fluid which are in relative motion. For a tube with a constant rate of flow, the strength of the compensating force is proportional to the fluid's viscosity. In general, viscosity depends on a fluid's state, such as its temperature, pressure, and rate of deformation. However, the dependence on some of these properties is negligible in certain cases. For example, the viscosity of a Newtonian fluid does not vary significantly with the rate of deformation. Zero viscosity (no resistance to shear stress ) is observed only at very low temperatures in superfluids ; otherwise, the second law of thermodynamics requires all fluids to have positive viscosity. [4] [5] A fluid that has zero viscosity (non-viscous) is called ideal or inviscid . Etymology [ edit ] The word ""viscosity"" is derived from the Latin viscum ("" mistletoe ""). Viscum also referred to a viscous glue derived from mistletoe berries. [6] Definitions [ edit ] Dynamic viscosity [ edit ] Illustration of a planar Couette flow . Since the shearing flow is opposed by friction between adjacent layers of fluid (which are in relative motion), a force is required to sustain the motion of the upper plate. The relative strength of this force is a measure of the fluid's viscosity. In a general parallel flow, the shear stress is proportional to the gradient of the velocity. In materials science and engineering , there is often interest in understanding the forces or stresses involved in the deformation of a material. For instance, if the material were a simple spring, the answer would be given by Hooke's law , which says that the force experienced by a spring is proportional to the distance displaced from equilibrium. Stresses which can be attributed to the deformation of a material from some rest state are called elastic stresses. In other materials, stresses are present which can be attributed to the deformation rate over time . These are called viscous stresses. For instance, in a fluid such as water the stresses which arise from shearing the fluid do not depend on the distance the fluid has been sheared; rather, they depend on how quickly the shearing occurs. Viscosity is the material property which relates the viscous stresses in a material to the rate of change of a deformation (the strain rate). Although it applies to general flows, it is easy to visualize and define in a simple shearing flow, such as a planar Couette flow . In the Couette flow, a fluid is trapped between two infinitely large plates, one fixed and one in parallel motion at constant speed u {\displaystyle u} (see illustration to the right). If the speed of the top plate is low enough (to avoid turbulence), then in steady state the fluid particles move parallel to it, and their speed varies from 0 {\displaystyle 0} at the bottom to u {\displaystyle u} at the top. [7] Each layer of fluid moves faster than the one just below it, and friction between them gives rise to a force resisting their relative motion. In particular, the fluid applies on the top plate a force in the direction opposite to its motion, and an equal but opposite force on the bottom plate. An external force is therefore required in order to keep the top plate moving at constant speed. In many fluids, the flow velocity is observed to vary linearly from zero at the bottom to u {\displaystyle u} at the top. Moreover, the magnitude of the force, F {\displaystyle F} , acting on the top plate is found to be proportional to the speed u {\displaystyle u} and the area A {\displaystyle A} of each plate, and inversely proportional to their separation y {\displaystyle y} : F = μ A u y . {\displaystyle F=\mu A{\frac {u}{y}}.} The proportionality factor is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, often simply referred to as the viscosity . It is denoted by the Greek letter mu ( μ ). The dynamic viscosity has the dimensions ( m a s s / l e n g t h ) / t i m e {\displaystyle \mathrm {(mass/length)/time} } , therefore resulting in the SI units and the derived units : [ μ ] = k g m ⋅ s = N m 2 ⋅ s = P a ⋅ s = {\displaystyle [\mu ]={\frac {\rm {kg}}{\rm {m{\cdot }s}}}={\frac {\rm {N}}{\rm {m^{2}}}}{\cdot }{\rm {s}}={\rm {Pa{\cdot }s}}=} pressure multiplied by time = {\displaystyle =} energy per unit volume multiplied by time. The aforementioned ratio u / y {\displaystyle u/y} is called the rate of shear deformation or shear velocity , and is the derivative of the fluid speed in the direction parallel to the normal vector of the plates (see illustrations to the right). If the velocity does not vary linearly with y {\displaystyle y} , then the appropriate generalization is: τ = μ ∂ u ∂ y , {\displaystyle \tau =\mu {\frac {\partial u}{\partial y}},} where τ = F / A {\displaystyle \tau =F/A} , and ∂ u / ∂ y {\displaystyle \partial u/\partial y} is the local shear velocity. This expression is referred to as Newton's law of viscosity . In shearing flows with planar symmetry, it is what defines μ {\displaystyle \mu } . It is a special case of the general definition of viscosity (see below), which can be expressed in coordinate-free form. Use of the Greek letter mu ( μ {\displaystyle \mu } ) for the dynamic viscosity (sometimes also called the absolute viscosity ) is common among mechanical and chemical engineers , as well as mathematicians and physicists. [8] [9] [10] However, the Greek letter eta ( η {\displaystyle \eta } ) is also used by chemists, physicists, and the IUPAC . [11] The viscosity μ {\displaystyle \mu } is sometimes also called the shear viscosity . However, at least one author discourages the use of this terminology, noting that μ {\displaystyle \mu } can appear in non-shearing flows in addition to shearing flows. [12] Kinematic viscosity [ edit ] In fluid dynamics, it is sometimes more appropriate to work in terms of kinematic viscosity (sometimes also called the momentum diffusivity ), defined as the ratio of the dynamic viscosity ( μ ) over the density of the fluid ( ρ ). It is usually denoted by the Greek letter nu ( ν ): ν = μ ρ , {\displaystyle \nu ={\frac {\mu }{\rho }},} and has the dimensions ( l e n g t h ) 2 / t i m e {\displaystyle \mathrm {(length)^{2}/time} } , therefore resulting in the SI units and the derived units : [ ν ] = m 2 s = N ⋅ m k g ⋅ s = J k g ⋅ s = {\displaystyle [\nu ]=\mathrm {\frac {m^{2}}{s}} =\mathrm {{\frac {N{\cdot }m}{kg}}{\cdot }s} =\mathrm {{\frac {J}{kg}}{\cdot }s} =} specific energy multiplied by time = {\displaystyle =} energy per unit mass multiplied by time. General definition [ edit ] See also: Viscous stress tensor and Volume viscosity In very general terms, the viscous stresses in a fluid are defined as those resulting from the relative velocity of different fluid particles. As such, the viscous stresses must depend on spatial gradients of the flow velocity. If the velocity gradients are small, then to a first approximation the viscous stresses depend only on the first derivatives of the velocity. [13] (For Newtonian fluids, this is also a linear dependence.) In Cartesian coordinates, the general relationship can then be written as τ i j = ∑ k ∑ ℓ μ i j k ℓ ∂ v k ∂ r ℓ , {\displaystyle \tau _{ij}=\sum _{k}\sum _{\ell }\mu _{ijk\ell }{\frac {\partial v_{k}}{\partial r_{\ell }}},} where μ i j k ℓ {\displaystyle \mu _{ijk\ell }} is a viscosity tensor that maps the velocity gradient tensor ∂ v k / ∂ r ℓ {\displaystyle \partial v_{k}/\partial r_{\ell }} onto the viscous stress tensor τ i j {\displaystyle \tau _{ij}} . [14] Since the indices in this expression can vary from 1 to 3, there are 81 ""viscosity coefficients"" μ i j k l {\displaystyle \mu _{ijkl}} in total. However, assuming that the viscosity rank-2 tensor is isotropic reduces these 81 coefficients to three independent parameters α {\displaystyle \alpha } , β {\displaystyle \beta } , γ {\displaystyle \gamma } : μ i j k ℓ = α δ i j δ k ℓ + β δ i k δ j ℓ + γ δ i ℓ δ j k , {\displaystyle \mu _{ijk\ell }=\alpha \delta _{ij}\delta _{k\ell }+\beta \delta _{ik}\delta _{j\ell }+\gamma \delta _{i\ell }\delta _{jk},} and furthermore, it is assumed that no viscous forces may arise when the fluid is undergoing simple rigid-body rotation, thus β = γ {\displaystyle \beta =\gamma } , leaving only two independent parameters. [13] The most usual decomposition is in terms of the standard (scalar) viscosity μ {\displaystyle \mu } and the bulk viscosity κ {\displaystyle \kappa } such that α = κ − 2 3 μ {\displaystyle \alpha =\kappa -{\tfrac {2}{3}}\mu } and β = γ = μ {\displaystyle \beta =\gamma =\mu } . In vector notation this appears as: τ = μ [ ∇ v + ( ∇ v ) T ] − ( 2 3 μ − κ ) ( ∇ ⋅ v ) δ , {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}=\mu \left[\nabla \mathbf {v} +(\nabla \mathbf {v} )^{\mathrm {T} }\right]-\left({\frac {2}{3}}\mu -\kappa \right)(\nabla \cdot \mathbf {v} )\mathbf {\delta } ,} where δ {\displaystyle \mathbf {\delta } } is the unit tensor. [12] [15] This equation can be thought of as a generalized form of Newton's law of viscosity. The bulk viscosity (also called volume viscosity) expresses a type of internal friction that resists the shearless compression or expansion of a fluid. Knowledge of κ {\displaystyle \kappa } is frequently not necessary in fluid dynamics problems. For example, an incompressible fluid satisfies ∇ ⋅ v = 0 {\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf {v} =0} and so the term containing κ {\displaystyle \kappa } drops out. Moreover, κ {\displaystyle \kappa } is often assumed to be negligible for gases since it is 0 {\displaystyle 0} in a monatomic ideal gas . [12] One situation in which κ {\displaystyle \kappa } can be important is the calculation of energy loss in sound and shock waves , described by Stokes' law of sound attenuation , since these phenomena involve rapid expansions and compressions. The defining equations for viscosity are not fundamental laws of nature, so their usefulness, as well as methods for measuring or calculating the viscosity, must be established using separate means. A potential issue is that viscosity depends, in principle, on the full microscopic state of the fluid, which encompasses the positions and momenta of every particle in the system. [16] Such highly detailed information is typically not available in realistic systems. However, under certain conditions most of this information can be shown to be negligible. In particular, for Newtonian fluids near equilibrium and far from boundaries (bulk state), the viscosity depends only space- and time-dependent macroscopic fields (such as temperature and density) defining local equilibrium. [16] [17] Nevertheless, viscosity may still carry a non-negligible dependence on several system properties, such as temperature, pressure, and the amplitude and frequency of any external forcing. Therefore, precision measurements of viscosity are only defined with respect to a specific fluid state. [18] To standardize comparisons among experiments and theoretical models, viscosity data is sometimes extrapolated to ideal limiting cases, such as the zero shear limit, or (for gases) the zero density limit. Momentum transport [ edit ] See also: Transport phenomena Transport theory provides an alternative interpretation of viscosity in terms of momentum transport: viscosity is the material property which characterizes momentum transport within a fluid, just as thermal conductivity characterizes heat transport, and (mass) diffusivity characterizes mass transport. [19] This perspective is implicit in Newton's law of viscosity, τ = μ ( ∂ u / ∂ y ) {\displaystyle \tau =\mu (\partial u/\partial y)} , because the shear stress τ {\displaystyle \tau } has units equivalent to a momentum flux , i.e., momentum per unit time per unit area. Thus, τ {\displaystyle \tau } can be interpreted as specifying the flow of momentum in the y {\displaystyle y} direction from one fluid layer to the next. Per Newton's law of viscosity, this momentum flow occurs across a velocity gradient, and the magnitude of the corresponding momentum flux is determined by the viscosity. The analogy with heat and mass transfer can be made explicit. Just as heat flows from high temperature to low temperature and mass flows from high density to low density, momentum flows from high velocity to low velocity. These behaviors are all described by compact expressions, called constitutive relations , whose one-dimensional forms are given here: J = − D ∂ ρ ∂ x (Fick's law of diffusion) q = − k t ∂ T ∂ x (Fourier's law of heat conduction) τ = μ ∂ u ∂ y (Newton's law of viscosity) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbf {J} &=-D{\frac {\partial \rho }{\partial x}}&&{\text{(Fick's law of diffusion)}}\\[5pt]\mathbf {q} &=-k_{t}{\frac {\partial T}{\partial x}}&&{\text{(Fourier's law of heat conduction)}}\\[5pt]\tau &=\mu {\frac {\partial u}{\partial y}}&&{\text{(Newton's law of viscosity)}}\end{aligned}}} where ρ {\displaystyle \rho } is the density, J {\displaystyle \mathbf {J} } and q {\displaystyle \mathbf {q} } are the mass and heat fluxes, and D {\displaystyle D} and k t {\displaystyle k_{t}} are the mass diffusivity and thermal conductivity. [20] The fact that mass, momentum, and energy (heat) transport are among the most relevant processes in continuum mechanics is not a coincidence: these are among the few physical quantities that are conserved at the microscopic level in interparticle collisions. Thus, rather than being dictated by the fast and complex microscopic interaction timescale, their dynamics occurs on macroscopic timescales, as described by the various equations of transport theory and hydrodynamics. Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids [ edit ] Viscosity, the slope of each line, varies among materials. Newton's law of viscosity is not a fundamental law of nature, but rather a constitutive equation (like Hooke's law , Fick's law , and Ohm's law ) which serves to define the viscosity μ {\displaystyle \mu } . Its form is motivated by experiments which show that for a wide range of fluids, μ {\displaystyle \mu } is independent of strain rate. Such fluids are called Newtonian . Gases , water , and many common liquids can be considered Newtonian in ordinary conditions and contexts. However, there are many non-Newtonian fluids that significantly deviate from this behavior. For example: Shear-thickening (dilatant) liquids, whose viscosity increases with the rate of shear strain. Shear-thinning liquids, whose viscosity decreases with the rate of shear strain. Thixotropic liquids, that become less viscous over time when shaken, agitated, or otherwise stressed. Rheopectic liquids, that become more viscous over time when shaken, agitated, or otherwise stressed. Bingham plastics that behave as a solid at low stresses but flow as a viscous fluid at high stresses. Trouton 's ratio is the ratio of extensional viscosity to shear viscosity . For a Newtonian fluid, the Trouton ratio is 3. [21] [22] Shear-thinning liquids are very commonly, but misleadingly, described as thixotropic. [23] Viscosity may also depend on the fluid's physical state (temperature and pressure) and other, external , factors. For gases and other compressible fluids , it depends on temperature and varies very slowly with pressure. The viscosity of some fluids may depend on other factors. A magnetorheological fluid , for example, becomes thicker when subjected to a magnetic field , possibly to the point of behaving like a solid. In solids [ edit ] The viscous forces that arise during fluid flow are distinct from the elastic forces that occur in a solid in response to shear, compression, or extension stresses. While in the latter the stress is proportional to the amount of shear deformation, in a fluid it is proportional to the rate of deformation over time. For this reason, James Clerk Maxwell used the term fugitive elasticity for fluid viscosity. However, many liquids (including water) will briefly react like elastic solids when subjected to sudden stress. Conversely, many ""solids"" (even granite ) will flow like liquids, albeit very slowly, even under arbitrarily small stress. [24] Such materials are best described as viscoelastic —that is, possessing both elasticity (reaction to deformation) and viscosity (reaction to rate of deformation). Viscoelastic solids may exhibit both shear viscosity and bulk viscosity. The extensional viscosity is a linear combination of the shear and bulk viscosities that describes the reaction of a solid elastic material to elongation. It is widely used for characterizing polymers. In geology , earth materials that exhibit viscous deformation at least three orders of magnitude greater than their elastic deformation are sometimes called rheids . [25] Measurement [ edit ] Main article: Viscometer Viscosity is measured with various types of viscometers and rheometers . Close temperature control of the fluid is essential to obtain accurate measurements, particularly in materials like lubricants, whose viscosity can double with a change of only 5 °C. A rheometer is used for fluids that cannot be defined by a single value of viscosity and therefore require more parameters to be set and measured than is the case for a viscometer. [26] For some fluids, the viscosity is constant over a wide range of shear rates ( Newtonian fluids ). The fluids without a constant viscosity ( non-Newtonian fluids ) cannot be described by a single number. Non-Newtonian fluids exhibit a variety of different correlations between shear stress and shear rate. One of the most common instruments for measuring kinematic viscosity is the glass capillary viscometer. In coating industries, viscosity may be measured with a cup in which the efflux time is measured. There are several sorts of cup—such as the Zahn cup and the Ford viscosity cup —with the usage of each type varying mainly according to the industry. Also used in coatings, a Stormer viscometer employs load-based rotation to determine viscosity. The viscosity is reported in Krebs units (KU), which are unique to Stormer viscometers. Vibrating viscometers can also be used to measure viscosity. Resonant, or vibrational viscometers work by creating shear waves within the liquid. In this method, the sensor is submerged in the fluid and is made to resonate at a specific frequency. As the surface of the sensor shears through the liquid, energy is lost due to its viscosity. This dissipated energy is then measured and converted into a viscosity reading. A higher viscosity causes a greater loss of energy. [ citation needed ] Extensional viscosity can be measured with various rheometers that apply extensional stress . Volume viscosity can be measured with an acoustic rheometer . Apparent viscosity is a calculation derived from tests performed on drilling fluid used in oil or gas well development. These calculations and tests help engineers develop and maintain the properties of the drilling fluid to the specifications required. Nanoviscosity (viscosity sensed by nanoprobes) can be measured by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy . [27] Units [ edit ] The SI unit of dynamic viscosity is the newton -second per square meter (N·s/m 2 ), also frequently expressed in the equivalent forms pascal - second (Pa·s), kilogram per meter per second (kg·m −1 ·s −1 ) and poiseuille (Pl). The CGS unit is the poise (P, or g·cm −1 ·s −1 = 0.1 Pa·s), [28] named after Jean Léonard Marie Poiseuille . It is commonly expressed, particularly in ASTM standards, as centipoise (cP). The centipoise is convenient because the viscosity of water at 20 °C is about 1 cP, and one centipoise is equal to the SI millipascal second (mPa·s). The SI unit of kinematic viscosity is square meter per second (m 2 /s), whereas the CGS unit for kinematic viscosity is the stokes (St, or cm 2 ·s −1 = 0.0001 m 2 ·s −1 ), named after Sir George Gabriel Stokes . [29] In U.S. usage, stoke is sometimes used as the singular form. The submultiple centistokes (cSt) is often used instead, 1 cSt = 1 mm 2 ·s −1 = 10 −6 m 2 ·s −1 . 1 cSt is 1 cP divided by 1000 kg/m^3, close to the density of water. The kinematic viscosity of water at 20 °C is about 1 cSt. The most frequently used systems of US customary, or Imperial , units are the British Gravitational (BG) and English Engineering (EE). In the BG system, dynamic viscosity has units of pound -seconds per square foot (lb·s/ft 2 ), and in the EE system it has units of pound-force -seconds per square foot (lbf·s/ft 2 ). The pound and pound-force are equivalent; the two systems differ only in how force and mass are defined. In the BG system the pound is a basic unit from which the unit of mass (the slug ) is defined by Newton's Second Law , whereas in the EE system the units of force and mass (the pound-force and pound-mass respectively) are defined independently through the Second Law using the proportionality constant g c . Kinematic viscosity has units of square feet per second (ft 2 /s) in both the BG and EE systems. Nonstandard units include the reyn (lbf·s/in 2 ), a British unit of dynamic viscosity. [30] In the automotive industry the viscosity index is used to describe the change of viscosity with temperature. The reciprocal of viscosity is fluidity , usually symbolized by ϕ = 1 / μ {\displaystyle \phi =1/\mu } or F = 1 / μ {\displaystyle F=1/\mu } , depending on the convention used, measured in reciprocal poise (P −1 , or cm · s · g −1 ), sometimes called the rhe . Fluidity is seldom used in engineering practice. [ citation needed ] At one time the petroleum industry relied on measuring kinematic viscosity by means of the Saybolt viscometer , and expressing kinematic viscosity in units of Saybolt universal seconds (SUS). [31] Other abbreviations such as SSU ( Saybolt seconds universal ) or SUV ( Saybolt universal viscosity ) are sometimes used. Kinematic viscosity in centistokes can be converted from SUS according to the arithmetic and the reference table provided in ASTM D 2161. Molecular origins [ edit ] Momentum transport in gases is mediated by discrete molecular collisions, and in liquids by attractive forces that bind molecules close together. [19] Because of this, the dynamic viscosities of liquids are typically much larger than those of gases. In addition, viscosity tends to increase with temperature in gases and decrease with temperature in liquids. Above the liquid-gas critical point , the liquid and gas phases are replaced by a single supercritical phase . In this regime, the mechanisms of momentum transport interpolate between liquid-like and gas-like behavior. For example, along a supercritical isobar (constant-pressure surface), the kinematic viscosity decreases at low temperature and increases at high temperature, with a minimum in between. [32] [33] A rough estimate for the value at the minimum is ν min = 1 4 π ℏ m e m {\displaystyle \nu _{\text{min}}={\frac {1}{4\pi }}{\frac {\hbar }{\sqrt {m_{\text{e}}m}}}} where ℏ {\displaystyle \hbar } is the Planck constant , m e {\displaystyle m_{\text{e}}} is the electron mass , and m {\displaystyle m} is the molecular mass. [33] In general, however, the viscosity of a system depends in detail on how the molecules constituting the system interact, and there are no simple but correct formulas for it. The simplest exact expressions are the Green–Kubo relations for the linear shear viscosity or the transient time correlation function expressions derived by Evans and Morriss in 1988. [34] Although these expressions are each exact, calculating the viscosity of a dense fluid using these relations currently requires the use of molecular dynamics computer simulations. Somewhat more progress can be made for a dilute gas, as elementary assumptions about how gas molecules move and interact lead to a basic understanding of the molecular origins of viscosity. More sophisticated treatments can be constructed by systematically coarse-graining the equations of motion of the gas molecules. An example of such a treatment is Chapman–Enskog theory , which derives expressions for the viscosity of a dilute gas from the Boltzmann equation . [17] Pure gases [ edit ] See also: Kinetic theory of gases Elementary calculation of viscosity for a dilute gas Consider a dilute gas moving parallel to the x {\displaystyle x} -axis with velocity u ( y ) {\displaystyle u(y)} that depends only on the y {\displaystyle y} coordinate. To simplify the discussion, the gas is assumed to have uniform temperature and density. Under these assumptions, the x {\displaystyle x} velocity of a molecule passing through y = 0 {\displaystyle y=0} is equal to whatever velocity that molecule had when its mean free path λ {\displaystyle \lambda } began. Because λ {\displaystyle \lambda } is typically small compared with macroscopic scales, the average x {\displaystyle x} velocity of such a molecule has the form u ( 0 ) ± α λ d u d y ( 0 ) , {\displaystyle u(0)\pm \alpha \lambda {\frac {du}{dy}}(0),} where α {\displaystyle \alpha } is a numerical constant on the order of 1 {\displaystyle 1} . (Some authors estimate α = 2 / 3 {\displaystyle \alpha =2/3} ; [19] [35] on the other hand, a more careful calculation for rigid elastic spheres gives α ≃ 0.998 {\displaystyle \alpha \simeq 0.998} .) Next, because half the molecules on either side are moving towards y = 0 {\displaystyle y=0} , and doing so on average with half the average molecular speed ( 8 k B T / π m ) 1 / 2 {\displaystyle (8k_{\text{B}}T/\pi m)^{1/2}} , the momentum flux from either side is 1 4 ρ ⋅ 8 k B T π m ⋅ ( u ( 0 ) ± α λ d u d y ( 0 ) ) . {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}\rho \cdot {\sqrt {\frac {8k_{\text{B}}T}{\pi m}}}\cdot \left(u(0)\pm \alpha \lambda {\frac {du}{dy}}(0)\right).} The net momentum flux at y = 0 {\displaystyle y=0} is the difference of the two: − 1 2 ρ ⋅ 8 k B T π m ⋅ α λ d u d y ( 0 ) . {\displaystyle -{\frac {1}{2}}\rho \cdot {\sqrt {\frac {8k_{\text{B}}T}{\pi m}}}\cdot \alpha \lambda {\frac {du}{dy}}(0).} According to the definition of viscosity, this momentum flux should be equal to − μ d u d y ( 0 ) {\displaystyle -\mu {\frac {du}{dy}}(0)} , which leads to μ = α ρ λ 2 k B T π m . {\displaystyle \mu =\alpha \rho \lambda {\sqrt {\frac {2k_{\text{B}}T}{\pi m}}}.} Viscosity in gases arises principally from the molecular diffusion that transports momentum between layers of flow. An elementary calculation for a dilute gas at temperature T {\displaystyle T} and density ρ {\displaystyle \rho } gives μ = α ρ λ 2 k B T π m , {\displaystyle \mu =\alpha \rho \lambda {\sqrt {\frac {2k_{\text{B}}T}{\pi m}}},} where k B {\displaystyle k_{\text{B}}} is the Boltzmann constant , m {\displaystyle m} the molecular mass, and α {\displaystyle \alpha } a numerical constant on the order of 1 {\displaystyle 1} . The quantity λ {\displaystyle \lambda } , the mean free path , measures the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. Even without a priori knowledge of α {\displaystyle \alpha } , this expression has nontrivial implications. In particular, since λ {\displaystyle \lambda } is typically inversely proportional to density and increases with temperature, μ {\displaystyle \mu } itself should increase with temperature and be independent of density at fixed temperature. In fact, both of these predictions persist in more sophisticated treatments, and accurately describe experimental observations. By contrast, liquid viscosity typically decreases with temperature. [19] [35] For rigid elastic spheres of diameter σ {\displaystyle \sigma } , λ {\displaystyle \lambda } can be computed, giving μ = α π 3 / 2 k B m T σ 2 . {\displaystyle \mu ={\frac {\alpha }{\pi ^{3/2}}}{\frac {\sqrt {k_{\text{B}}mT}}{\sigma ^{2}}}.} In this case λ {\displaystyle \lambda } is independent of temperature, so μ ∝ T 1 / 2 {\displaystyle \mu \propto T^{1/2}} . For more complicated molecular models, however, λ {\displaystyle \lambda } depends on temperature in a non-trivial way, and simple kinetic arguments as used here are inadequate. More fundamentally, the notion of a mean free path becomes imprecise for particles that interact over a finite range, which limits the usefulness of the concept for describing real-world gases. [36] Chapman–Enskog theory [ edit ] Main article: Chapman–Enskog theory A technique developed by Sydney Chapman and David Enskog in the early 1900s allows a more refined calculation of μ {\displaystyle \mu } . [17] It is based on the Boltzmann equation , which provides a statistical description of a dilute gas in terms of intermolecular interactions. [37] The technique allows accurate calculation of μ {\displaystyle \mu } for molecular models that are more realistic than rigid elastic spheres, such as those incorporating intermolecular attractions. Doing so is necessary to reproduce the correct temperature dependence of μ {\displaystyle \mu } , which experiments show increases more rapidly than the T 1 / 2 {\displaystyle T^{1/2}} trend predicted for rigid elastic spheres. [19] Indeed, the Chapman–Enskog analysis shows that the predicted temperature dependence can be tuned by varying the parameters in various molecular models. A simple example is the Sutherland model, [a] which describes rigid elastic spheres with weak mutual attraction. In such a case, the attractive force can be treated perturbatively , which leads to a simple expression for μ {\displaystyle \mu } : μ = 5 16 σ 2 ( k B m T π ) 1 / 2 ( 1 + S T ) − 1 , {\displaystyle \mu ={\frac {5}{16\sigma ^{2}}}\left({\frac {k_{\text{B}}mT}{\pi }}\right)^{\!\!1/2}\ \left(1+{\frac {S}{T}}\right)^{\!\!-1},} where S {\displaystyle S} is independent of temperature, being determined only by the parameters of the intermolecular attraction. To connect with experiment, it is convenient to rewrite as μ = μ 0 ( T T 0 ) 3 / 2 T 0 + S T + S , {\displaystyle \mu =\mu _{0}\left({\frac {T}{T_{0}}}\right)^{\!\!3/2}\ {\frac {T_{0}+S}{T+S}},} where μ 0 {\displaystyle \mu _{0}} is the viscosity at temperature T 0 {\displaystyle T_{0}} . This expression is usually named Sutherland's formula. [38] If μ {\displaystyle \mu } is known from experiments at T = T 0 {\displaystyle T=T_{0}} and at least one other temperature, then S {\displaystyle S} can be calculated. Expressions for μ {\displaystyle \mu } obtained in this way are qualitatively accurate for a number of simple gases. Slightly more sophisticated models, such as the Lennard-Jones potential , or the more flexible Mie potential , may provide better agreement with experiments, but only at the cost of a more opaque dependence on temperature. A further advantage of these more complex interaction potentials is that they can be used to develop accurate models for a wide variety of properties using the same potential parameters. In situations where little experimental data is available, this makes it possible to obtain model parameters from fitting to properties such as pure-fluid vapour-liquid equilibria , before using the parameters thus obtained to predict the viscosities of interest with reasonable accuracy. In some systems, the assumption of spherical symmetry must be abandoned, as is the case for vapors with highly polar molecules like H 2 O . In these cases, the Chapman–Enskog analysis is significantly more complicated. [39] [40] Bulk viscosity [ edit ] See also: Bulk viscosity In the kinetic-molecular picture, a non-zero bulk viscosity arises in gases whenever there are non-negligible relaxational timescales governing the exchange of energy between the translational energy of molecules and their internal energy, e.g. rotational and vibrational . As such, the bulk viscosity is 0 {\displaystyle 0} for a monatomic ideal gas, in which the internal energy of molecules is negligible, but is nonzero for a gas like carbon dioxide , whose molecules possess both rotational and vibrational energy. [41] [42] Pure liquids [ edit ] See also: Temperature dependence of viscosity § Liquids Video showing three liquids with different viscosities Experiment showing the behavior of a viscous fluid with blue dye for visibility In contrast with gases, there is no simple yet accurate picture for the molecular origins of viscosity in liquids. At the simplest level of description, the relative motion of adjacent layers in a liquid is opposed primarily by attractive molecular forces acting across the layer boundary. In this picture, one (correctly) expects viscosity to decrease with increasing temperature. This is because increasing temperature increases the random thermal motion of the molecules, which makes it easier for them to overcome their attractive interactions. [43] Building on this visualization, a simple theory can be constructed in analogy with the discrete structure of a solid: groups of molecules in a liquid are visualized as forming ""cages"" which surround and enclose single molecules. [44] These cages can be occupied or unoccupied, and stronger molecular attraction corresponds to stronger cages. Due to random thermal motion, a molecule ""hops"" between cages at a rate which varies inversely with the strength of molecular attractions. In equilibrium these ""hops"" are not biased in any direction. On the other hand, in order for two adjacent layers to move relative to each other, the ""hops"" must be biased in the direction of the relative motion. The force required to sustain this directed motion can be estimated for a given shear rate, leading to μ ≈ N A h V exp ⁡ ( 3.8 T b T ) , {\displaystyle \mu \approx {\frac {N_{\text{A}}h}{V}}\operatorname {exp} \left(3.8{\frac {T_{\text{b}}}{T}}\right),} ( 1 ) where N A {\displaystyle N_{\text{A}}} is the Avogadro constant , h {\displaystyle h} is the Planck constant , V {\displaystyle V} is the volume of a mole of liquid, and T b {\displaystyle T_{\text{b}}} is the normal boiling point . This result has the same form as the well-known empirical relation μ = A e B / T , {\displaystyle \mu =Ae^{B/T},} ( 2 ) where A {\displaystyle A} and B {\displaystyle B} are constants fit from data. [44] [45] On the other hand, several authors express caution with respect to this model. Errors as large as 30% can be encountered using equation ( 1 ), compared with fitting equation ( 2 ) to experimental data. [44] More fundamentally, the physical assumptions underlying equation ( 1 ) have been criticized. [46] It has also been argued that the exponential dependence in equation ( 1 ) does not necessarily describe experimental observations more accurately than simpler, non-exponential expressions. [47] [48] In light of these shortcomings, the development of a less ad hoc model is a matter of practical interest. Foregoing simplicity in favor of precision, it is possible to write rigorous expressions for viscosity starting from the fundamental equations of motion for molecules. A classic example of this approach is Irving–Kirkwood theory. [49] On the other hand, such expressions are given as averages over multiparticle correlation functions and are therefore difficult to apply in practice. In general, empirically derived expressions (based on existing viscosity measurements) appear to be the only consistently reliable means of calculating viscosity in liquids. [50] Local atomic structure changes observed in undercooled liquids on cooling below the equilibrium melting temperature either in terms of radial distribution function g ( r ) [51] or structure factor S ( Q ) [52] are found to be directly responsible for the liquid fragility: deviation of the temperature dependence of viscosity of the undercooled liquid from the Arrhenius equation (2) through modification of the activation energy for viscous flow. At the same time equilibrium liquids follow the Arrhenius equation. Mixtures and blends [ edit ] See also: Viscosity models for mixtures Gaseous mixtures [ edit ] The same molecular-kinetic picture of a single component gas can also be applied to a gaseous mixture. For instance, in the Chapman–Enskog approach the viscosity μ mix {\displaystyle \mu _{\text{mix}}} of a binary mixture of gases can be written in terms of the individual component viscosities μ 1 , 2 {\displaystyle \mu _{1,2}} , their respective volume fractions, and the intermolecular interactions. [17] As for the single-component gas, the dependence of μ mix {\displaystyle \mu _{\text{mix}}} on the parameters of the intermolecular interactions enters through various collisional integrals which may not be expressible in closed form . To obtain usable expressions for μ mix {\displaystyle \mu _{\text{mix}}} which reasonably match experimental data, the collisional integrals may be computed numerically or from correlations. [53] In some cases, the collision integrals are regarded as fitting parameters, and are fitted directly to experimental data. [54] This is a common approach in the development of reference equations for gas-phase viscosities. An example of such a procedure is the Sutherland approach for the single-component gas, discussed above. For gas mixtures consisting of simple molecules, Revised Enskog Theory has been shown to accurately represent both the density- and temperature dependence of the viscosity over a wide range of conditions. [55] [53] Blends of liquids [ edit ] As for pure liquids, the viscosity of a blend of liquids is difficult to predict from molecular principles. One method is to extend the molecular ""cage"" theory presented above for a pure liquid. This can be done with varying levels of sophistication. One expression resulting from such an analysis is the Lederer–Roegiers equation for a binary mixture: ln ⁡ μ blend = x 1 x 1 + α x 2 ln ⁡ μ 1 + α x 2 x 1 + α x 2 ln ⁡ μ 2 , {\displaystyle \ln \mu _{\text{blend}}={\frac {x_{1}}{x_{1}+\alpha x_{2}}}\ln \mu _{1}+{\frac {\alpha x_{2}}{x_{1}+\alpha x_{2}}}\ln \mu _{2},} where α {\displaystyle \alpha } is an empirical parameter, and x 1 , 2 {\displaystyle x_{1,2}} and μ 1 , 2 {\displaystyle \mu _{1,2}} are the respective mole fractions and viscosities of the component liquids. [56] Since blending is an important process in the lubricating and oil industries, a variety of empirical and propriety equations exist for predicting the viscosity of a blend. [56] Solutions and suspensions [ edit ] Aqueous solutions [ edit ] See also: Debye–Hückel theory and List of viscosities § Aqueous solutions Depending on the solute and range of concentration, an aqueous electrolyte solution can have either a larger or smaller viscosity compared with pure water at the same temperature and pressure. For instance, a 20% saline ( sodium chloride ) solution has viscosity over 1.5 times that of pure water, whereas a 20% potassium iodide solution has viscosity about 0.91 times that of pure water. An idealized model of dilute electrolytic solutions leads to the following prediction for the viscosity μ s {\displaystyle \mu _{s}} of a solution: [57] μ s μ 0 = 1 + A c , {\displaystyle {\frac {\mu _{s}}{\mu _{0}}}=1+A{\sqrt {c}},} where μ 0 {\displaystyle \mu _{0}} is the viscosity of the solvent, c {\displaystyle c} is the concentration, and A {\displaystyle A} is a positive constant which depends on both solvent and solute properties. However, this expression is only valid for very dilute solutions, having c {\displaystyle c} less than 0.1 mol/L. [58] For higher concentrations, additional terms are necessary which account for higher-order molecular correlations: μ s μ 0 = 1 + A c + B c + C c 2 , {\displaystyle {\frac {\mu _{s}}{\mu _{0}}}=1+A{\sqrt {c}}+Bc+Cc^{2},} where B {\displaystyle B} and C {\displaystyle C} are fit from data. In particular, a negative value of B {\displaystyle B} is able to account for the decrease in viscosity observed in some solutions. Estimated values of these constants are shown below for sodium chloride and potassium iodide at temperature 25 °C (mol = mole , L = liter ). [57] Solute A {\displaystyle A} (mol −1/2 L 1/2 ) B {\displaystyle B} (mol −1 L) C {\displaystyle C} (mol −2 L 2 ) Sodium chloride (NaCl) 0.0062 0.0793 0.0080 Potassium iodide (KI) 0.0047 −0.0755 0.0000 Suspensions [ edit ] In a suspension of solid particles (e.g. micron -size spheres suspended in oil), an effective viscosity μ eff {\displaystyle \mu _{\text{eff}}} can be defined in terms of stress and strain components which are averaged over a volume large compared with the distance between the suspended particles, but small with respect to macroscopic dimensions. [59] Such suspensions generally exhibit non-Newtonian behavior. However, for dilute systems in steady flows, the behavior is Newtonian and expressions for μ eff {\displaystyle \mu _{\text{eff}}} can be derived directly from the particle dynamics. In a very dilute system, with volume fraction ϕ ≲ 0.02 {\displaystyle \phi \lesssim 0.02} , interactions between the suspended particles can be ignored. In such a case one can explicitly calculate the flow field around each particle independently, and combine the results to obtain μ eff {\displaystyle \mu _{\text{eff}}} . For spheres, this results in the Einstein's effective viscosity formula: μ eff = μ 0 ( 1 + 5 2 ϕ ) , {\displaystyle \mu _{\text{eff}}=\mu _{0}\left(1+{\frac {5}{2}}\phi \right),} where μ 0 {\displaystyle \mu _{0}} is the viscosity of the suspending liquid. The linear dependence on ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } is a consequence of neglecting interparticle interactions. For dilute systems in general, one expects μ eff {\displaystyle \mu _{\text{eff}}} to take the form μ eff = μ 0 ( 1 + B ϕ ) , {\displaystyle \mu _{\text{eff}}=\mu _{0}\left(1+B\phi \right),} where the coefficient B {\displaystyle B} may depend on the particle shape (e.g. spheres, rods, disks). [60] Experimental determination of the precise value of B {\displaystyle B} is difficult, however: even the prediction B = 5 / 2 {\displaystyle B=5/2} for spheres has not been conclusively validated, with various experiments finding values in the range 1.5 ≲ B ≲ 5 {\displaystyle 1.5\lesssim B\lesssim 5} . This deficiency has been attributed to difficulty in controlling experimental conditions. [61] In denser suspensions, μ eff {\displaystyle \mu _{\text{eff}}} acquires a nonlinear dependence on ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } , which indicates the importance of interparticle interactions. Various analytical and semi-empirical schemes exist for capturing this regime. At the most basic level, a term quadratic in ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } is added to μ eff {\displaystyle \mu _{\text{eff}}} : μ eff = μ 0 ( 1 + B ϕ + B 1 ϕ 2 ) , {\displaystyle \mu _{\text{eff}}=\mu _{0}\left(1+B\phi +B_{1}\phi ^{2}\right),} and the coefficient B 1 {\displaystyle B_{1}} is fit from experimental data or approximated from the microscopic theory. However, some authors advise caution in applying such simple formulas since non-Newtonian behavior appears in dense suspensions ( ϕ ≳ 0.25 {\displaystyle \phi \gtrsim 0.25} for spheres), [61] or in suspensions of elongated or flexible particles. [59] There is a distinction between a suspension of solid particles, described above, and an emulsion . The latter is a suspension of tiny droplets, which themselves may exhibit internal circulation. The presence of internal circulation can decrease the observed effective viscosity, and different theoretical or semi-empirical models must be used. [62] Amorphous materials [ edit ] Common glass viscosity curves [63] In the high and low temperature limits, viscous flow in amorphous materials (e.g. in glasses and melts) [64] [65] [66] has the Arrhenius form : μ = A e Q / ( R T ) , {\displaystyle \mu =Ae^{Q/(RT)},} where Q is a relevant activation energy , given in terms of molecular parameters; T is temperature; R is the molar gas constant ; and A is approximately a constant. The activation energy Q takes a different value depending on whether the high or low temperature limit is being considered: it changes from a high value Q H at low temperatures (in the glassy state) to a low value Q L at high temperatures (in the liquid state). Common logarithm of viscosity against temperature for B 2 O 3 , showing two regimes For intermediate temperatures, Q {\displaystyle Q} varies nontrivially with temperature and the simple Arrhenius form fails. On the other hand, the two-exponential equation μ = A T exp ⁡ ( B R T ) [ 1 + C exp ⁡ ( D R T ) ] , {\displaystyle \mu =AT\exp \left({\frac {B}{RT}}\right)\left[1+C\exp \left({\frac {D}{RT}}\right)\right],} where A {\displaystyle A} , B {\displaystyle B} , C {\displaystyle C} , D {\displaystyle D} are all constants, provides a good fit to experimental data over the entire range of temperatures, while at the same time reducing to the correct Arrhenius form in the low and high temperature limits. This expression can be motivated from various theoretical models of amorphous materials at the atomic level. [65] A two-exponential equation for the viscosity can be derived within the Dyre shoving model of supercooled liquids, where the Arrhenius energy barrier is identified with the high-frequency shear modulus times a characteristic shoving volume. [67] [68] Upon specifying the temperature dependence of the shear modulus via thermal expansion and via the repulsive part of the intermolecular potential, another two-exponential equation is retrieved: [69] μ = exp ⁡ { V c C G k B T exp ⁡ [ ( 2 + λ ) α T T g ( 1 − T T g ) ] } {\displaystyle \mu =\exp {\left\{{\frac {V_{c}C_{G}}{k_{B}T}}\exp {\left[(2+\lambda )\alpha _{T}T_{g}\left(1-{\frac {T}{T_{g}}}\right)\right]}\right\}}} where C G {\displaystyle C_{G}} denotes the high-frequency shear modulus of the material evaluated at a temperature equal to the glass transition temperature T g {\displaystyle T_{g}} , V c {\displaystyle V_{c}} is the so-called shoving volume, i.e. it is the characteristic volume of the group of atoms involved in the shoving event by which an atom/molecule escapes from the cage of nearest-neighbours, typically on the order of the volume occupied by few atoms. Furthermore, α T {\displaystyle \alpha _{T}} is the thermal expansion coefficient of the material, λ {\displaystyle \lambda } is a parameter which measures the steepness of the power-law rise of the ascending flank of the first peak of the radial distribution function , and is quantitatively related to the repulsive part of the interatomic potential . [69] Finally, k B {\displaystyle k_{B}} denotes the Boltzmann constant . Eddy viscosity [ edit ] In the study of turbulence in fluids , a common practical strategy is to ignore the small-scale vortices (or eddies ) in the motion and to calculate a large-scale motion with an effective viscosity, called the ""eddy viscosity"", which characterizes the transport and dissipation of energy in the smaller-scale flow (see large eddy simulation ). [70] [71] In contrast to the viscosity of the fluid itself, which must be positive by the second law of thermodynamics , the eddy viscosity can be negative. [72] [73] Prediction [ edit ] Because viscosity depends continuously on temperature and pressure, it cannot be fully characterized by a finite number of experimental measurements. Predictive formulas become necessary if experimental values are not available at the temperatures and pressures of interest. This capability is important for thermophysical simulations, in which the temperature and pressure of a fluid can vary continuously with space and time. A similar situation is encountered for mixtures of pure fluids, where the viscosity depends continuously on the concentration ratios of the constituent fluids For the simplest fluids, such as dilute monatomic gases and their mixtures, ab initio quantum mechanical computations can accurately predict viscosity in terms of fundamental atomic constants, i.e., without reference to existing viscosity measurements. [74] For the special case of dilute helium, uncertainties in the ab initio calculated viscosity are two order of magnitudes smaller than uncertainties in experimental values. [75] For slightly more complex fluids and mixtures at moderate densities (i.e. sub-critical densities ) Revised Enskog Theory can be used to predict viscosities with some accuracy. [53] Revised Enskog Theory is predictive in the sense that predictions for viscosity can be obtained using parameters fitted to other, pure-fluid thermodynamic properties or transport properties , thus requiring no a priori experimental viscosity measurements. For most fluids, high-accuracy, first-principles computations are not feasible. Rather, theoretical or empirical expressions must be fit to existing viscosity measurements. If such an expression is fit to high-fidelity data over a large range of temperatures and pressures, then it is called a ""reference correlation"" for that fluid. Reference correlations have been published for many pure fluids; a few examples are water , carbon dioxide , ammonia , benzene , and xenon . [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] Many of these cover temperature and pressure ranges that encompass gas, liquid, and supercritical phases. Thermophysical modeling software often relies on reference correlations for predicting viscosity at user-specified temperature and pressure. These correlations may be proprietary . Examples are REFPROP [81] (proprietary) and CoolProp [82] (open-source). Viscosity can also be computed using formulas that express it in terms of the statistics of individual particle trajectories. These formulas include the Green–Kubo relations for the linear shear viscosity and the transient time correlation function expressions derived by Evans and Morriss in 1988. [83] [34] The advantage of these expressions is that they are formally exact and valid for general systems. The disadvantage is that they require detailed knowledge of particle trajectories, available only in computationally expensive simulations such as molecular dynamics . An accurate model for interparticle interactions is also required, which may be difficult to obtain for complex molecules. [84] Selected substances [ edit ] In the University of Queensland pitch drop experiment , pitch has been dripping slowly through a funnel since 1927, at a rate of one drop roughly every decade. In this way the viscosity of pitch has been determined to be approximately 230 billion ( 2.3 × 10 11 ) times that of water. [85] Main article: List of viscosities Observed values of viscosity vary over several orders of magnitude, even for common substances (see the order of magnitude table below). For instance, a 70% sucrose (sugar) solution has a viscosity over 400 times that of water, and 26,000 times that of air. [86] More dramatically, pitch has been estimated to have a viscosity 230 billion times that of water. [85] Water [ edit ] The dynamic viscosity μ {\displaystyle \mu } of water is about 0.89 mPa·s at room temperature (25 °C). As a function of temperature in kelvins , the viscosity can be estimated using the semi-empirical Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann equation : μ = A exp ⁡ ( B T − C ) {\displaystyle \mu =A\exp \left({\frac {B}{T-C}}\right)} where A = 0.02939 mPa·s, B = 507.88 K, and C = 149.3 K. [87] Experimentally determined values of the viscosity are also given in the table below. The values at 20 °C are a useful reference: there, the dynamic viscosity is about 1 cP and the kinematic viscosity is about 1 cSt. Viscosity of water at various temperatures [86] Temperature (°C) Viscosity (mPa·s or cP) 10 1.305 9 20 1.001 6 30 0.797 22 50 0.546 52 70 0.403 55 90 0.314 17 Air [ edit ] Under standard atmospheric conditions (25 °C and pressure of 1 bar), the dynamic viscosity of air is 18.5 μPa·s, roughly 50 times smaller than the viscosity of water at the same temperature. Except at very high pressure, the viscosity of air depends mostly on the temperature. Among the many possible approximate formulas for the temperature dependence (see Temperature dependence of viscosity ), one is: [88] η air = 2.791 × 10 − 7 × T 0.7355 {\displaystyle \eta _{\text{air}}=2.791\times 10^{-7}\times T^{0.7355}} which is accurate in the range −20 °C to 400 °C. For this formula to be valid, the temperature must be given in kelvins ; η air {\displaystyle \eta _{\text{air}}} then corresponds to the viscosity in Pa·s.

For the acoustics theorem, see Stokes's law of sound attenuation . Not to be confused with Stokes' theorem in vector calculus, or Stokes shift in luminescence and Raman spectroscopy . In fluid dynamics , Stokes' law is an empirical law for the frictional force – also called drag force – exerted on spherical objects with very small Reynolds numbers in a viscous fluid . [1] It was derived by George Gabriel Stokes in 1851 by solving the Stokes flow limit for small Reynolds numbers of the Navier–Stokes equations . [2] Statement of the law [ edit ] The force of viscosity on a small sphere moving through a viscous fluid is given by: [3] [4] F d = 6 π μ R v {\displaystyle F_{\rm {d}}=6\pi \mu Rv} where (in SI units ): F d is the frictional force – known as Stokes' drag – acting on the interface between the fluid and the particle ( newtons , kg m s −2 ); μ (some authors use the symbol η ) is the dynamic viscosity ( Pascal -seconds, kg m −1 s −1 ); R is the radius of the spherical object (meters); ⁠ v {\displaystyle v} ⁠ is the flow velocity relative to the object (meters per second). Stokes' law makes the following assumptions for the behavior of a particle in a fluid: Laminar flow No inertial effects (zero Reynolds number ) Spherical particles Homogeneous (uniform in composition) material Smooth surfaces Particles do not interfere with each other. Depending on desired accuracy, the failure to meet these assumptions may or may not require the use of a more complicated model. To 10% error, for instance, velocities need be limited to those giving Re < 1. For molecules Stokes' law is used to define their Stokes radius and diameter . The CGS unit of kinematic viscosity was named ""stokes"" after his work. Applications [ edit ] Stokes' law is the basis of the falling-sphere viscometer , in which the fluid is stationary in a vertical glass tube. A sphere of known size and density is allowed to descend through the liquid. If correctly selected, it reaches terminal velocity, which can be measured by the time it takes to pass two marks on the tube. Electronic sensing can be used for opaque fluids. Knowing the terminal velocity, the size and density of the sphere, and the density of the liquid, Stokes' law can be used to calculate the viscosity of the fluid. A series of steel ball bearings of different diameters are normally used in the classic experiment to improve the accuracy of the calculation. The school experiment uses glycerine or golden syrup as the fluid, and the technique is used industrially to check the viscosity of fluids used in processes. Several school experiments often involve varying the temperature and/or concentration of the substances used in order to demonstrate the effects this has on the viscosity. Industrial methods include many different oils , and polymer liquids such as solutions. The importance of Stokes' law is illustrated by the fact that it played a critical role in the research leading to at least three Nobel Prizes. [5] Stokes' law is important for understanding the swimming of microorganisms and sperm ; also, the sedimentation of small particles and organisms in water, under the force of gravity. [5] In air, the same theory can be used to explain why small water droplets (or ice crystals) can remain suspended in air (as clouds) until they grow to a critical size and start falling as rain (or snow and hail). [6] Similar use of the equation can be made in the settling of fine particles in water or other fluids. [ citation needed ] Terminal velocity of sphere falling in a fluid [ edit ] Creeping flow past a falling sphere in a fluid (e.g., a droplet of fog falling through the air): streamlines , drag force F d and force by gravity F g . At terminal (or settling) velocity , the excess force F e due to the difference between the weight and buoyancy of the sphere (both caused by gravity [7] ) is given by: F e = ( ρ p − ρ f ) g 4 3 π R 3 , {\displaystyle F_{e}=(\rho _{p}-\rho _{f})\,g\,{\frac {4}{3}}\pi \,R^{3},} where (in SI units ): ρ p is the mass density of the sphere [kg/m 3 ] ρ f is the mass density of the fluid [kg/m 3 ] g is the gravitational acceleration [m/s 2 ] Requiring the force balance F d = F e and solving for the velocity v gives the terminal velocity v s . Note that since the excess force increases as R 3 and Stokes' drag increases as R , the terminal velocity increases as R 2 and thus varies greatly with particle size as shown below. If a particle only experiences its own weight while falling in a viscous fluid, then a terminal velocity is reached when the sum of the frictional and the buoyant forces on the particle due to the fluid exactly balances the gravitational force . This velocity v [m/s] is given by: [7] v = 2 9 ρ p − ρ f μ g R 2 { ρ p > ρ f ⟹ v → vertically downwards ρ p < ρ f ⟹ v → vertically upwards {\displaystyle v={\frac {2}{9}}{\frac {\rho _{p}-\rho _{f}}{\mu }}g\,R^{2}\quad {\begin{cases}\rho _{p}>\rho _{f}&\implies {\vec {v}}{\text{ vertically downwards}}\\\rho _{p}<\rho _{f}&\implies {\vec {v}}{\text{ vertically upwards}}\end{cases}}} where (in SI units): g is the gravitational field strength [m/s 2 ] R is the radius of the spherical particle [m] ρ p is the mass density of the particle [kg/m 3 ] ρ f is the mass density of the fluid [kg/m 3 ] μ is the dynamic viscosity [kg/(m•s)]. Derivation [ edit ] Steady Stokes flow [ edit ] In Stokes flow , at very low Reynolds number , the convective acceleration terms in the Navier–Stokes equations are neglected. Then the flow equations become, for an incompressible steady flow : [8] ∇ p = μ ∇ 2 u = − μ ∇ × ω , ∇ ⋅ u = 0 , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&\nabla p=\mu \,\nabla ^{2}\mathbf {u} =-\mu \,\nabla \times \mathbf {\boldsymbol {\omega }} ,\\[2pt]&\nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} =0,\end{aligned}}} where: p is the fluid pressure (in Pa), u is the flow velocity (in m/s), and ω is the vorticity (in s −1 ), defined as ω = ∇ × u . {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\omega }}=\nabla \times \mathbf {u} .} By using some vector calculus identities , these equations can be shown to result in Laplace's equations for the pressure and each of the components of the vorticity vector: [8] ∇ 2 ω = 0 {\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}{\boldsymbol {\omega }}=0} and ∇ 2 p = 0. {\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}p=0.} Additional forces like those by gravity and buoyancy have not been taken into account, but can easily be added since the above equations are linear, so linear superposition of solutions and associated forces can be applied. Transversal flow around a sphere [ edit ] Streamlines of creeping flow past a sphere in a fluid. Isocontours of the ψ function (values in contour labels). For the case of a sphere in a uniform far field flow, it is advantageous to use a cylindrical coordinate system ( r , φ , z ) . The z –axis is through the centre of the sphere and aligned with the mean flow direction, while r is the radius as measured perpendicular to the z –axis. The origin is at the sphere centre. Because the flow is axisymmetric around the z –axis, it is independent of the azimuth φ . In this cylindrical coordinate system, the incompressible flow can be described with a Stokes stream function ψ , depending on r and z : [9] [10] u z = 1 r ∂ ψ ∂ r , u r = − 1 r ∂ ψ ∂ z , {\displaystyle u_{z}={\frac {1}{r}}{\frac {\partial \psi }{\partial r}},\qquad u_{r}=-{\frac {1}{r}}{\frac {\partial \psi }{\partial z}},} with u r and u z the flow velocity components in the r and z direction, respectively. The azimuthal velocity component in the φ –direction is equal to zero, in this axisymmetric case. The volume flux, through a tube bounded by a surface of some constant value ψ , is equal to 2 πψ and is constant. [9] For this case of an axisymmetric flow, the only non-zero component of the vorticity vector ω is the azimuthal φ –component ω φ [11] [12] ω φ = ∂ u r ∂ z − ∂ u z ∂ r = − ∂ ∂ r ( 1 r ∂ ψ ∂ r ) − 1 r ∂ 2 ψ ∂ z 2 . {\displaystyle \omega _{\varphi }={\frac {\partial u_{r}}{\partial z}}-{\frac {\partial u_{z}}{\partial r}}=-{\frac {\partial }{\partial r}}\left({\frac {1}{r}}{\frac {\partial \psi }{\partial r}}\right)-{\frac {1}{r}}\,{\frac {\partial ^{2}\psi }{\partial z^{2}}}.} The Laplace operator , applied to the vorticity ω φ , becomes in this cylindrical coordinate system with axisymmetry: [12] ∇ 2 ω φ = 1 r ∂ ∂ r ( r ∂ ω φ ∂ r ) + ∂ 2 ω φ ∂ z 2 − ω φ r 2 = 0. {\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}\omega _{\varphi }={\frac {1}{r}}{\frac {\partial }{\partial r}}\left(r\,{\frac {\partial \omega _{\varphi }}{\partial r}}\right)+{\frac {\partial ^{2}\omega _{\varphi }}{\partial z^{2}}}-{\frac {\omega _{\varphi }}{r^{2}}}=0.} From the previous two equations, and with the appropriate boundary conditions, for a far-field uniform-flow velocity u in the z –direction and a sphere of radius R , the solution is found to be [13] ψ ( r , z ) = − 1 2 u r 2 [ 1 − 3 2 R r 2 + z 2 + 1 2 ( R r 2 + z 2 ) 3 ] . {\displaystyle \psi (r,z)=-{\frac {1}{2}}\,u\,r^{2}\,\left[1-{\frac {3}{2}}{\frac {R}{\sqrt {r^{2}+z^{2}}}}+{\frac {1}{2}}\left({\frac {R}{\sqrt {r^{2}+z^{2}}}}\right)^{3}\;\right].} The solution of velocity in cylindrical coordinates and components follows as: u r ( r , z ) = 3 R r z u 4 r 2 + z 2 ( ( R r 2 + z 2 ) 2 − 1 r 2 + z 2 ) u z ( r , z ) = u + 3 R u 4 r 2 + z 2 ( 2 R 2 + 3 r 2 3 ( r 2 + z 2 ) − ( r R r 2 + z 2 ) 2 − 2 ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}u_{r}(r,z)&={\frac {3Rrzu}{4{\sqrt {r^{2}+z^{2}}}}}\left(\left({\frac {R}{r^{2}+z^{2}}}\right)^{2}-{\frac {1}{r^{2}+z^{2}}}\right)\\[4pt]u_{z}(r,z)&=u+{\frac {3Ru}{4{\sqrt {r^{2}+z^{2}}}}}\left({\frac {2R^{2}+3r^{2}}{3(r^{2}+z^{2})}}-\left({\frac {rR}{r^{2}+z^{2}}}\right)^{2}-2\right)\end{aligned}}} Stokes-Flow around sphere with parameters of Far-Field velocity u ∞ = ( 6 0 6 ) T m/s {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} _{\infty }={\begin{pmatrix}6&0&6\end{pmatrix}}^{T}{\text{m/s}}} , radius of sphere R = 1 m {\displaystyle R=1\;{\text{m}}} , viscosity of water (T = 20°C) μ = 1 mPa ⋅ s {\displaystyle \mu =1\;{\text{mPa}}\cdot {\text{s}}} . Shown are the field-lines of velocity-field and the amplitudes of velocity, pressure and vorticity with pseudo-colors. The solution of vorticity in cylindrical coordinates follows as: ω φ ( r , z ) = − 3 R u 2 ⋅ r r 2 + z 2 3 {\displaystyle \omega _{\varphi }(r,z)=-{\frac {3Ru}{2}}\cdot {\frac {r}{{\sqrt {r^{2}+z^{2}}}^{3}}}} The solution of pressure in cylindrical coordinates follows as: p ( r , z ) = − 3 μ R u 2 ⋅ z r 2 + z 2 3 {\displaystyle p(r,z)=-{\frac {3\mu Ru}{2}}\cdot {\frac {z}{{\sqrt {r^{2}+z^{2}}}^{3}}}} The solution of pressure in spherical coordinates follows as: p ( r , θ ) = − 3 μ R u 2 ⋅ cos ⁡ θ r 2 {\displaystyle p(r,\theta )=-{\frac {3\mu Ru}{2}}\cdot {\frac {\cos \theta }{r^{2}}}} The formula of pressure is also called dipole potential analogous to the concept in electrostatics. A more general formulation, with arbitrary far-field velocity-vector u ∞ {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} _{\infty }} , in cartesian coordinates x = ( x , y , z ) T {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} =(x,y,z)^{T}} follows with: u ( x ) = R 3 4 ⋅ ( 3 ( u ∞ ⋅ x ) ⋅ x ‖ x ‖ 5 − u ∞ ‖ x ‖ 3 ) ⏟ conservative: curl=0, ∇ 2 u = 0 + u ∞ ⏟ far-field ⏟ Terms of Boundary-Condition − 3 R 4 ⋅ ( u ∞ ‖ x ‖ + ( u ∞ ⋅ x ) ⋅ x ‖ x ‖ 3 ) ⏟ non-conservative: curl = ω ( x ) , μ ∇ 2 u = ∇ p = [ 3 R 3 4 x ⊗ x ‖ x ‖ 5 − R 3 4 I ‖ x ‖ 3 − 3 R 4 x ⊗ x ‖ x ‖ 3 − 3 R 4 I ‖ x ‖ + I ] ⋅ u ∞ {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbf {u} (\mathbf {x} )&=\underbrace {\underbrace {{\frac {R^{3}}{4}}\cdot \left({\frac {3\left(\mathbf {u} _{\infty }\cdot \mathbf {x} \right)\cdot \mathbf {x} }{\|\mathbf {x} \|^{5}}}-{\frac {\mathbf {u} _{\infty }}{\|\mathbf {x} \|^{3}}}\right)} _{{\text{conservative: curl=0,}}\ \nabla ^{2}\mathbf {u} =0}+\underbrace {\mathbf {u} _{\infty }} _{\text{far-field}}} _{\text{Terms of Boundary-Condition}}\;\underbrace {-{\frac {3R}{4}}\cdot \left({\frac {\mathbf {u} _{\infty }}{\|\mathbf {x} \|}}+{\frac {\left(\mathbf {u} _{\infty }\cdot \mathbf {x} \right)\cdot \mathbf {x} }{\|\mathbf {x} \|^{3}}}\right)} _{{\text{non-conservative: curl}}={\boldsymbol {\omega }}(\mathbf {x} ),\ \mu \nabla ^{2}\mathbf {u} =\nabla p}\\[8pt]&=\left[{\frac {3R^{3}}{4}}{\frac {\mathbf {x\otimes \mathbf {x} } }{\|\mathbf {x} \|^{5}}}-{\frac {R^{3}}{4}}{\frac {\mathbf {I} }{\|\mathbf {x} \|^{3}}}-{\frac {3R}{4}}{\frac {\mathbf {x} \otimes \mathbf {x} }{\|\mathbf {x} \|^{3}}}-{\frac {3R}{4}}{\frac {\mathbf {I} }{\|\mathbf {x} \|}}+\mathbf {I} \right]\cdot \mathbf {u} _{\infty }\end{aligned}}} ω ( x ) = − 3 R 2 ⋅ u ∞ × x ‖ x ‖ 3 {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\omega }}(\mathbf {x} )=-{\frac {3R}{2}}\cdot {\frac {\mathbf {u} _{\infty }\times \mathbf {x} }{\|\mathbf {x} \|^{3}}}} p ( x ) = − 3 μ R 2 ⋅ u ∞ ⋅ x ‖ x ‖ 3 {\displaystyle p\left(\mathbf {x} \right)=-{\frac {3\mu R}{2}}\cdot {\frac {\mathbf {u} _{\infty }\cdot \mathbf {x} }{\|\mathbf {x} \|^{3}}}} In this formulation the non-conservative term represents a kind of so-called Stokeslet . The Stokeslet is the Green's function of the Stokes-Flow-Equations. The conservative term is equal to the dipole gradient field . The formula of vorticity is analogous to the Biot–Savart law in electromagnetism . Alternatively, in a more compact way, one can formulate the velocity field as follows: u ( x ) = [ I + H ( R 3 4 1 ‖ x ‖ ) − S ( 3 R 4 ‖ x ‖ ) ] ⋅ u ∞ , ‖ x ‖ ≥ R {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} (\mathbf {x} )=\left[\mathbf {I} +\mathrm {H} \left({\frac {R^{3}}{4}}{\frac {1}{\|\mathbf {x} \|}}\right)-\mathrm {S} \left({\frac {3R}{4}}\|\mathbf {x} \|\right)\right]\cdot \mathbf {u} _{\infty },\quad \|\mathbf {x} \|\geq R} , where H = ∇ ⊗ ∇ {\displaystyle \mathrm {H} =\nabla \otimes \nabla } is the Hessian matrix differential operator and S = I ∇ 2 − H {\displaystyle \mathrm {S} =\mathbf {I} \nabla ^{2}-\mathrm {H} } is a differential operator composed as the difference of the Laplacian and the Hessian. In this way it becomes explicitly clear, that the solution is composed from derivatives of a Coulomb-type potential ( 1 / ‖ x ‖ {\displaystyle 1/\|\mathbf {x} \|} ) and a Biharmonic-type potential ( ‖ x ‖ {\displaystyle \|\mathbf {x} \|} ). The differential operator S {\displaystyle \mathrm {S} } applied to the vector norm ‖ x ‖ {\displaystyle \|\mathbf {x} \|} generates the Stokeslet. The following formula describes the viscous stress tensor for the special case of Stokes flow. It is needed in the calculation of the force acting on the particle. In Cartesian coordinates the vector-gradient ∇ u {\displaystyle \nabla \mathbf {u} } is identical to the Jacobian matrix . The matrix I represents the identity-matrix . σ = − p ⋅ I + μ ⋅ ( ( ∇ u ) + ( ∇ u ) T ) {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}=-p\cdot \mathbf {I} +\mu \cdot \left((\nabla \mathbf {u} )+(\nabla \mathbf {u} )^{T}\right)} The force acting on the sphere is to calculate by surface-integral, where e r represents the radial unit-vector of spherical-coordinates : F = ∬ ∂ V ⊂ ⊃ σ ⋅ d S = ∫ 0 π ∫ 0 2 π σ ⋅ e r ⋅ R 2 sin ⁡ θ d φ d θ = ∫ 0 π ∫ 0 2 π 3 μ ⋅ u ∞ 2 R ⋅ R 2 sin ⁡ θ d φ d θ = 6 π μ R ⋅ u ∞ {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbf {F} &=\iint _{\partial V}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\subset \!\supset \;{\boldsymbol {\sigma }}\cdot {\text{d}}\mathbf {S} \\[4pt]&=\int _{0}^{\pi }\int _{0}^{2\pi }{\boldsymbol {\sigma }}\cdot \mathbf {e_{r}} \cdot R^{2}\sin \theta {\text{d}}\varphi {\text{d}}\theta \\[4pt]&=\int _{0}^{\pi }\int _{0}^{2\pi }{\frac {3\mu \cdot \mathbf {u} _{\infty }}{2R}}\cdot R^{2}\sin \theta {\text{d}}\varphi {\text{d}}\theta \\[4pt]&=6\pi \mu R\cdot \mathbf {u} _{\infty }\end{aligned}}} Rotational flow around a sphere [ edit ] Stokes-Flow around sphere: ω R = ( 0 0 2 ) T Hz {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\omega }}_{R}={\begin{pmatrix}0&0&2\end{pmatrix}}^{T}\;{\text{Hz}}} , μ = 1 mPa ⋅ s {\displaystyle \mu =1\;{\text{mPa}}\cdot {\text{s}}} , R = 1 m {\displaystyle R=1\;{\text{m}}} u ( x ) = − R 3 ⋅ ω R × x ‖ x ‖ 3 ω ( x ) = R 3 ⋅ ω R ‖ x ‖ 3 − 3 R 3 ⋅ ( ω R ⋅ x ) ⋅ x ‖ x ‖ 5 p ( x ) = 0 σ = − p ⋅ I + μ ⋅ ( ( ∇ u ) + ( ∇ u ) T ) T = ∬ ∂ V ⊂ ⊃ x × ( σ ⋅ d S ) = ∫ 0 π ∫ 0 2 π ( R ⋅ e r ) × ( σ ⋅ e r ⋅ R 2 sin ⁡ θ d φ d θ ) = 8 π μ R 3 ⋅ ω R {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbf {u} (\mathbf {x} )&=-\;R^{3}\cdot {\frac {{\boldsymbol {\omega }}_{R}\times \mathbf {x} }{\|\mathbf {x} \|^{3}}}\\[8pt]{\boldsymbol {\omega }}(\mathbf {x} )&={\frac {R^{3}\cdot {\boldsymbol {\omega }}_{R}}{\|\mathbf {x} \|^{3}}}-{\frac {3R^{3}\cdot ({\boldsymbol {\omega }}_{R}\cdot \mathbf {x} )\cdot \mathbf {x} }{\|\mathbf {x} \|^{5}}}\\[8pt]p(\mathbf {x} )&=0\\[8pt]{\boldsymbol {\sigma }}&=-p\cdot \mathbf {I} +\mu \cdot \left((\nabla \mathbf {u} )+(\nabla \mathbf {u} )^{T}\right)\\[8pt]\mathbf {T} &=\iint _{\partial V}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\subset \!\supset \mathbf {x} \times \left({\boldsymbol {\sigma }}\cdot {\text{d}}{\boldsymbol {S}}\right)\\&=\int _{0}^{\pi }\int _{0}^{2\pi }(R\cdot \mathbf {e_{r}} )\times \left({\boldsymbol {\sigma }}\cdot \mathbf {e_{r}} \cdot R^{2}\sin \theta {\text{d}}\varphi {\text{d}}\theta \right)\\&=8\pi \mu R^{3}\cdot {\boldsymbol {\omega }}_{R}\end{aligned}}} Other types of Stokes flow [ edit ] This section is about steady Stokes flow around a sphere. For the forces on a sphere in unsteady Stokes flow, see Basset–Boussinesq–Oseen equation . Although the liquid is static and the sphere is moving with a certain velocity, with respect to the frame of sphere, the sphere is at rest and liquid is flowing in the opposite direction to the motion of the sphere.

The jet exhibits a wide range of length scales, an important characteristic of turbulent flows. Millennium Prize Problems Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture Hodge conjecture Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness P versus NP problem Poincaré conjecture (solved) Riemann hypothesis Yang–Mills existence and mass gap v t e The Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness problem concerns the mathematical properties of solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations , a system of partial differential equations that describe the motion of a fluid in space. Solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations are used in many practical applications. However, theoretical understanding of the solutions to these equations is incomplete. In particular, solutions of the Navier–Stokes equations often include turbulence , which remains one of the greatest unsolved problems in physics , despite its immense importance in science and engineering. Even more basic (and seemingly intuitive) properties of the solutions to Navier–Stokes have never been proven. For the three-dimensional system of equations, and given some initial conditions , mathematicians have neither proved that smooth solutions always exist, nor found any counter-examples. This is called the Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness problem. Since understanding the Navier–Stokes equations is considered to be the first step to understanding the elusive phenomenon of turbulence , the Clay Mathematics Institute in May 2000 made this problem one of its seven Millennium Prize problems in mathematics. It offered a US$1,000,000 prize to the first person providing a solution for a specific statement of the problem: [1] Prove or give a counter-example of the following statement: In three space dimensions and time, given an initial velocity field, there exists a vector velocity and a scalar pressure field, which are both smooth and globally defined, that solve the Navier–Stokes equations. The Navier–Stokes equations [ edit ] Main article: Navier–Stokes equations In mathematics, the Navier–Stokes equations are a system of nonlinear partial differential equations for abstract vector fields of any size. In physics and engineering, they are a system of equations that model the motion of liquids or non- rarefied gases (in which the mean free path is short enough so that it can be thought of as a continuum mean instead of a collection of particles) using continuum mechanics . The equations are a statement of Newton's second law , with the forces modeled according to those in a viscous Newtonian fluid —as the sum of contributions by pressure, viscous stress and an external body force. Since the setting of the problem proposed by the Clay Mathematics Institute is in three dimensions, for an incompressible and homogeneous fluid, only that case is considered below. Let v ( x , t ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} ({\boldsymbol {x}},t)} be a 3-dimensional vector field, the velocity of the fluid, and let p ( x , t ) {\displaystyle p({\boldsymbol {x}},t)} be the pressure of the fluid. [note 1] The Navier–Stokes equations are: ∂ v ∂ t + ( v ⋅ ∇ ) v = − 1 ρ ∇ p + ν Δ v + f ( x , t ) {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \mathbf {v} }{\partial t}}+(\mathbf {v} \cdot \nabla )\mathbf {v} =-{\frac {1}{\rho }}\nabla p+\nu \Delta \mathbf {v} +\mathbf {f} ({\boldsymbol {x}},t)} where ν > 0 {\displaystyle \nu >0} is the kinematic viscosity , f ( x , t ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {f} ({\boldsymbol {x}},t)} the external volumetric force, ∇ {\displaystyle \nabla } is the gradient operator and Δ {\displaystyle \displaystyle \Delta } is the Laplacian operator, which is also denoted by ∇ ⋅ ∇ {\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \nabla } or ∇ 2 {\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}} . Note that this is a vector equation, i.e. it has three scalar equations. Writing down the coordinates of the velocity and the external force v ( x , t ) = ( v 1 ( x , t ) , v 2 ( x , t ) , v 3 ( x , t ) ) , f ( x , t ) = ( f 1 ( x , t ) , f 2 ( x , t ) , f 3 ( x , t ) ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} ({\boldsymbol {x}},t)={\big (}\,v_{1}({\boldsymbol {x}},t),\,v_{2}({\boldsymbol {x}},t),\,v_{3}({\boldsymbol {x}},t)\,{\big )}\,,\qquad \mathbf {f} ({\boldsymbol {x}},t)={\big (}\,f_{1}({\boldsymbol {x}},t),\,f_{2}({\boldsymbol {x}},t),\,f_{3}({\boldsymbol {x}},t)\,{\big )}} then for each i = 1 , 2 , 3 {\displaystyle i=1,2,3} there is the corresponding scalar Navier–Stokes equation: ∂ v i ∂ t + ∑ j = 1 3 ∂ v i ∂ x j v j = − 1 ρ ∂ p ∂ x i + ν ∑ j = 1 3 ∂ 2 v i ∂ x j 2 + f i ( x , t ) . {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial v_{i}}{\partial t}}+\sum _{j=1}^{3}{\frac {\partial v_{i}}{\partial x_{j}}}v_{j}=-{\frac {1}{\rho }}{\frac {\partial p}{\partial x_{i}}}+\nu \sum _{j=1}^{3}{\frac {\partial ^{2}v_{i}}{\partial x_{j}^{2}}}+f_{i}({\boldsymbol {x}},t).} The unknowns are the velocity v ( x , t ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} ({\boldsymbol {x}},t)} and the pressure p ( x , t ) {\displaystyle p({\boldsymbol {x}},t)} . Since in three dimensions, there are three equations and four unknowns (three scalar velocities and the pressure), then a supplementary equation is needed. This extra equation is the continuity equation for incompressible fluids that describes the conservation of mass of the fluid: ∇ ⋅ v = 0. {\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf {v} =0.} Due to this last property, the solutions for the Navier–Stokes equations are searched in the set of solenoidal ("" divergence -free"") functions. For this flow of a homogeneous medium, density and viscosity are constants. Since only its gradient appears, the pressure p can be eliminated by taking the curl of both sides of the Navier–Stokes equations. In this case the Navier–Stokes equations reduce to the vorticity-transport equations . The Navier–Stokes equations are nonlinear because the terms in the equations do not have a simple linear relationship with each other. This means that the equations cannot be solved using traditional linear techniques, and more advanced methods must be used instead. Nonlinearity is important in the Navier–Stokes equations because it allows the equations to describe a wide range of fluid dynamics phenomena, including the formation of shock waves and other complex flow patterns. However, the nonlinearity of the Navier–Stokes equations also makes them more difficult to solve, as traditional linear methods may not work. One way to understand the nonlinearity of the Navier–Stokes equations is to consider the term (v · ∇)v in the equations. This term represents the acceleration of the fluid, and it is a product of the velocity vector v and the gradient operator ∇. Because the gradient operator is a linear operator, the term (v · ∇)v is nonlinear in the velocity vector v. This means that the acceleration of the fluid depends on the magnitude and direction of the velocity, as well as the spatial distribution of the velocity within the fluid. The nonlinear nature of the Navier–Stokes equations can be seen in the term ( v ⋅ ∇ ) v {\displaystyle (\mathbf {v} \cdot \nabla )\mathbf {v} } , which represents the acceleration of the fluid due to its own velocity. This term is nonlinear because it involves the product of two velocity vectors, and the resulting acceleration is therefore dependent on the magnitude and direction of both vectors. Another source of nonlinearity in the Navier–Stokes equations is the pressure term − 1 ρ ∇ p {\displaystyle -{\frac {1}{\rho }}\nabla p} . The pressure in a fluid depends on the density and the gradient of the pressure, and this term is therefore nonlinear in the pressure. One example of the nonlinear nature of the Navier–Stokes equations can be seen in the case of a fluid flowing around a circular obstacle. In this case, the velocity of the fluid near the obstacle will be higher than the velocity of the fluid farther away from the obstacle. This results in a pressure gradient, with higher pressure near the obstacle and lower pressure farther away. To see this more explicitly, consider the case of a circular obstacle of radius R {\displaystyle R} placed in a uniform flow with velocity v 0 {\displaystyle \mathbf {v_{0}} } and density ρ {\displaystyle \rho } . Let v ( x , t ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} (\mathbf {x} ,t)} be the velocity of the fluid at position x {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} } and time t {\displaystyle t} , and let p ( x , t ) {\displaystyle p(\mathbf {x} ,t)} be the pressure at the same position and time. The Navier–Stokes equations in this case are: ∂ v ∂ t + ( v ⋅ ∇ ) v = − 1 ρ ∇ p + ν Δ v {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \mathbf {v} }{\partial t}}+(\mathbf {v} \cdot \nabla )\mathbf {v} =-{\frac {1}{\rho }}\nabla p+\nu \Delta \mathbf {v} } ∇ ⋅ v = 0 {\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf {v} =0} where ν {\displaystyle \nu } is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid. Assuming that the flow is steady (meaning that the velocity and pressure do not vary with time), we can set the time derivative terms equal to zero: ( v ⋅ ∇ ) v = − 1 ρ ∇ p + ν Δ v {\displaystyle (\mathbf {v} \cdot \nabla )\mathbf {v} =-{\frac {1}{\rho }}\nabla p+\nu \Delta \mathbf {v} } ∇ ⋅ v = 0 {\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf {v} =0} We can now consider the flow near the circular obstacle. In this region, the velocity of the fluid will be higher than the uniform flow velocity v 0 {\displaystyle \mathbf {v_{0}} } due to the presence of the obstacle. This results in a nonlinear term ( v ⋅ ∇ ) v {\displaystyle (\mathbf {v} \cdot \nabla )\mathbf {v} } in the Navier–Stokes equations that is proportional to the velocity of the fluid. At the same time, the presence of the obstacle will also result in a pressure gradient, with higher pressure near the obstacle and lower pressure farther away. This can be seen by considering the continuity equation, which states that the mass flow rate through any surface must be constant. Since the velocity is higher near the obstacle, the mass flow rate through a surface near the obstacle will be higher than the mass flow rate through a surface farther away from the obstacle. This can be compensated for by a pressure gradient, with higher pressure near the obstacle and lower pressure farther away. As a result of these nonlinear effects, the Navier–Stokes equations in this case become difficult to solve, and approximations or numerical methods must be used to find the velocity and pressure fields in the flow. Consider the case of a two-dimensional fluid flow in a rectangular domain, with a velocity field v ( x , t ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} (x,t)} and a pressure field p ( x , t ) {\displaystyle p(x,t)} . We can use a finite element method to solve the Navier–Stokes equation for the velocity field: ∂ u ∂ t + u ∂ u ∂ x + v ∂ u ∂ y = − 1 ρ ∂ p ∂ x + ν ( ∂ 2 u ∂ x 2 + ∂ 2 u ∂ y 2 ) + f x ( x , y , t ) {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial u}{\partial t}}+u{\frac {\partial u}{\partial x}}+v{\frac {\partial u}{\partial y}}=-{\frac {1}{\rho }}{\frac {\partial p}{\partial x}}+\nu \left({\frac {\partial ^{2}u}{\partial x^{2}}}+{\frac {\partial ^{2}u}{\partial y^{2}}}\right)+f_{x}(x,y,t)} To do this, we divide the domain into a series of smaller elements, and represent the velocity field as: u ( x , y , t ) = ∑ i = 1 N U i ( t ) ϕ i ( x , y ) {\displaystyle u(x,y,t)=\sum _{i=1}^{N}U_{i}(t)\phi _{i}(x,y)} where N {\displaystyle N} is the number of elements, and ϕ i ( x , y ) {\displaystyle \phi _{i}(x,y)} are the shape functions associated with each element. Substituting this expression into the Navier–Stokes equation and applying the finite element method, we can derive a system of ordinary differential equations: d U i d t = − 1 ρ ∑ j = 1 N ( ∂ p ∂ x ) j ∫ Ω ϕ j ∂ ϕ i ∂ x d Ω + ν ∑ j = 1 N ∫ Ω ( ∂ 2 u ∂ x 2 ) ϕ j ∂ 2 ϕ i ∂ x 2 d Ω + ∫ Ω f x ϕ i d Ω {\displaystyle {\frac {dU_{i}}{dt}}=-{\frac {1}{\rho }}\sum _{j=1}^{N}\left({\frac {\partial p}{\partial x}}\right)j\int {\Omega }\phi _{j}{\frac {\partial \phi _{i}}{\partial x}}d\Omega +\nu \sum _{j=1}^{N}\int _{\Omega }\left({\frac {\partial ^{2}u}{\partial x^{2}}}\right)\phi _{j}{\frac {\partial ^{2}\phi _{i}}{\partial x^{2}}}d\Omega +\int {\Omega }f_{x}\phi _{i}d\Omega } where Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } is the domain, and the integrals are over the domain. This system of ordinary differential equations can be solved using techniques such as the finite element method or spectral methods. Here, we will use the finite difference method. To do this, we can divide the time interval [ t 0 , t f ] {\displaystyle [t_{0},t_{f}]} into a series of smaller time steps, and approximate the derivative at each time step using a finite difference formula: U i + 1 − U i Δ t ≈ − 1 ρ ∑ j = 1 N ( ∂ p ∂ x ) j ∫ Ω ϕ j ∂ ϕ i ∂ x d Ω + ν ∑ j = 1 N ∫ Ω ( ∂ 2 u ∂ x 2 ) j ϕ j ∂ 2 ϕ i ∂ x 2 d Ω + ∫ Ω f x ϕ i d Ω {\displaystyle {\frac {U_{i+1}-U_{i}}{\Delta t}}\approx -{\frac {1}{\rho }}\sum _{j=1}^{N}\left({\frac {\partial p}{\partial x}}\right)j\int {\Omega }\phi _{j}{\frac {\partial \phi _{i}}{\partial x}}d\Omega +\nu \sum _{j=1}^{N}\int _{\Omega }\left({\frac {\partial ^{2}u}{\partial x^{2}}}\right)j\phi _{j}{\frac {\partial ^{2}\phi _{i}}{\partial x^{2}}}d\Omega +\int {\Omega }f_{x}\phi _{i}d\Omega } where Δ t = t i + 1 − t i {\displaystyle \Delta t=t_{i+1}-t_{i}} is the size of the time step, and U i {\displaystyle U_{i}} and t i {\displaystyle t_{i}} are the values of U i {\displaystyle U_{i}} and t {\displaystyle t} at time step i {\displaystyle i} . Using this approximation, we can iterate through the time steps and compute the value of U i {\displaystyle U_{i}} at each time step. For example, starting at time step i {\displaystyle i} and using the approximation above, we can compute the value of U i {\displaystyle U_{i}} at time step i + 1 {\displaystyle i+1} : U i + 1 = U i + Δ t ⋅ ( − 1 ρ ∑ j = 1 N ( ∂ p ∂ x ) j ∫ Ω ϕ j ∂ ϕ i ∂ x d Ω + ν ∑ j = 1 N ∫ Ω ( ∂ 2 u ∂ x 2 ) j ϕ j ∂ 2 ϕ i ∂ x 2 d Ω + ∫ Ω f x ϕ i d Ω ) {\displaystyle U_{i+1}=U_{i}+\Delta t\cdot \left(-{\frac {1}{\rho }}\sum _{j=1}^{N}\left({\frac {\partial p}{\partial x}}\right)j\int {\Omega }\phi _{j}{\frac {\partial \phi _{i}}{\partial x}}d\Omega +\nu \sum _{j=1}^{N}\int _{\Omega }\left({\frac {\partial ^{2}u}{\partial x^{2}}}\right)_{j}\phi _{j}{\frac {\partial ^{2}\phi _{i}}{\partial x^{2}}}d\Omega +\int _{\Omega }f_{x}\phi _{i}d\Omega \right)} This process can be repeated until we reach the final time step t f {\displaystyle t_{f}} . There are many other approaches to solving ordinary differential equations, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The choice of approach depends on the specific equation being solved, and the desired accuracy and efficiency of the solution. Two settings: unbounded and periodic space [ edit ] There are two different settings for the one-million-dollar-prize Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness problem. The original problem is in the whole space R 3 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}} , which needs extra conditions on the growth behavior of the initial condition and the solutions. In order to rule out the problems at infinity, the Navier–Stokes equations can be set in a periodic framework, which implies that they are no longer working on the whole space R 3 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}} but in the 3-dimensional torus T 3 = R 3 / Z 3 {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} ^{3}=\mathbb {R} ^{3}/\mathbb {Z} ^{3}} . Each case will be treated separately. Statement of the problem in the whole space [ edit ] Hypotheses and growth conditions [ edit ] The initial condition v 0 ( x ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{0}(x)} is assumed to be a smooth and divergence-free function (see smooth function ) such that, for every multi-index α {\displaystyle \alpha } (see multi-index notation ) and any K > 0 {\displaystyle K>0} , there exists a constant C = C ( α , K ) > 0 {\displaystyle C=C(\alpha ,K)>0} such that | ∂ α v 0 ( x ) | ≤ C ( 1 + | x | ) K {\displaystyle \vert \partial ^{\alpha }\mathbf {v_{0}} (x)\vert \leq {\frac {C}{(1+\vert x\vert )^{K}}}\qquad } for all x ∈ R 3 . {\displaystyle \qquad x\in \mathbb {R} ^{3}.} The external force f ( x , t ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {f} (x,t)} is assumed to be a smooth function as well, and satisfies a very analogous inequality (now the multi-index includes time derivatives as well): | ∂ α f ( x , t ) | ≤ C ( 1 + | x | + t ) K {\displaystyle \vert \partial ^{\alpha }\mathbf {f} (x,t)\vert \leq {\frac {C}{(1+\vert x\vert +t)^{K}}}\qquad } for all ( x , t ) ∈ R 3 × [ 0 , ∞ ) . {\displaystyle \qquad (x,t)\in \mathbb {R} ^{3}\times [0,\infty ).} For physically reasonable conditions, the type of solutions expected are smooth functions that do not grow large as | x | → ∞ {\displaystyle \vert x\vert \to \infty } . More precisely, the following assumptions are made: v ( x , t ) ∈ C ∞ ( R 3 × [ 0 , ∞ ) ) , p ( x , t ) ∈ C ∞ ( R 3 × [ 0 , ∞ ) ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} (x,t)\in C^{\infty }(\mathbb {R} ^{3}\times [0,\infty )),\qquad p(x,t)\in C^{\infty }(\mathbb {R} ^{3}\times [0,\infty ))} There exists a constant E ∈ ( 0 , ∞ ) {\displaystyle E\in (0,\infty )} such that ∫ R 3 | v ( x , t ) | 2 d x < E {\displaystyle \int _{\mathbb {R} ^{3}}\vert \mathbf {v} (x,t)\vert ^{2}\,dx<E} for all t ≥ 0 . {\displaystyle t\geq 0\,.} Condition 1 implies that the functions are smooth and globally defined and condition 2 means that the kinetic energy of the solution is globally bounded. The Millennium Prize conjectures in the whole space [ edit ] (A) Existence and smoothness of the Navier–Stokes solutions in R 3 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}} Let f ( x , t ) ≡ 0 {\displaystyle \mathbf {f} (x,t)\equiv 0} . For any initial condition v 0 ( x ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{0}(x)} satisfying the above hypotheses there exist smooth and globally defined solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations, i.e. there is a velocity vector v ( x , t ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} (x,t)} and a pressure p ( x , t ) {\displaystyle p(x,t)} satisfying conditions 1 and 2 above. (B) Breakdown of the Navier–Stokes solutions in R 3 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}} There exists an initial condition v 0 ( x ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{0}(x)} and an external force f ( x , t ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {f} (x,t)} such that there exists no solutions v ( x , t ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} (x,t)} and p ( x , t ) {\displaystyle p(x,t)} satisfying conditions 1 and 2 above. The Millennium Prize conjectures are two mathematical problems that were chosen by the Clay Mathematics Institute as the most important unsolved problems in mathematics. The first conjecture, which is known as the ""smoothness"" conjecture, states that there should always exist smooth and globally defined solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations in three-dimensional space. The second conjecture, known as the ""breakdown"" conjecture, states that there should be at least one set of initial conditions and external forces for which there are no smooth solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations. The Navier–Stokes equations are a set of partial differential equations that describe the motion of fluids. They are given by: ∂ v ∂ t + ( v ⋅ ∇ ) v = − 1 ρ ∇ p + ν ∇ 2 v + f {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \mathbf {v} }{\partial t}}+(\mathbf {v} \cdot \nabla )\mathbf {v} =-{\frac {1}{\rho }}\nabla p+\nu \nabla ^{2}\mathbf {v} +\mathbf {f} } ∇ ⋅ v = 0 {\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf {v} =0} where v ( x , t ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} (x,t)} is the velocity field of the fluid, p ( x , t ) {\displaystyle p(x,t)} is the pressure, ρ {\displaystyle \rho } is the density, ν {\displaystyle \nu } is the kinematic viscosity, and f ( x , t ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {f} (x,t)} is an external force. The first equation is known as the momentum equation, and the second equation is known as the continuity equation. These equations are typically accompanied by boundary conditions, which describe the behavior of the fluid at the edges of the domain. For example, in the case of a fluid flowing through a pipe, the boundary conditions might specify that the velocity and pressure are fixed at the walls of the pipe. The Navier–Stokes equations are nonlinear and highly coupled, making them difficult to solve in general. In particular, the difficulty of solving these equations lies in the term ( v ⋅ ∇ ) v {\displaystyle (\mathbf {v} \cdot \nabla )\mathbf {v} } , which represents the nonlinear advection of the velocity field by itself. This term makes the Navier–Stokes equations highly sensitive to initial conditions, and it is the main reason why the Millennium Prize conjectures are so challenging. In addition to the mathematical challenges of solving the Navier–Stokes equations, there are also many practical challenges in applying these equations to real-world situations. For example, the Navier–Stokes equations are often used to model fluid flows that are turbulent, which means that the fluid is highly chaotic and unpredictable. Turbulence is a difficult phenomenon to model and understand, and it adds another layer of complexity to the problem of solving the Navier–Stokes equations. To solve the Navier–Stokes equations, we need to find a velocity field v ( x , t ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} (x,t)} and a pressure field p ( x , t ) {\displaystyle p(x,t)} that satisfy the equations and the given boundary conditions. This can be done using a variety of numerical techniques, such as finite element methods, spectral methods, or finite difference methods. For example, consider the case of a two-dimensional fluid flow in a rectangular domain, with velocity and pressure fields v ( x , t ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} (x,t)} and a pressure field p ( x , t ) {\displaystyle p(x,t)} ,respectively. The Navier–Stokes equations can be written as: ∂ u ∂ t + u ∂ u ∂ x + v ∂ u ∂ y = − 1 ρ ∂ p ∂ x + ν ( ∂ 2 u ∂ x 2 + ∂ 2 u ∂ y 2 ) + f x ( x , y , t ) {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial u}{\partial t}}+u{\frac {\partial u}{\partial x}}+v{\frac {\partial u}{\partial y}}=-{\frac {1}{\rho }}{\frac {\partial p}{\partial x}}+\nu \left({\frac {\partial ^{2}u}{\partial x^{2}}}+{\frac {\partial ^{2}u}{\partial y^{2}}}\right)+f_{x}(x,y,t)} ∂ v ∂ t + u ∂ v ∂ x + v ∂ v ∂ y = − 1 ρ ∂ p ∂ y + ν ( ∂ 2 v ∂ x 2 + ∂ 2 v ∂ y 2 ) + f y ( x , y , t ) {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial v}{\partial t}}+u{\frac {\partial v}{\partial x}}+v{\frac {\partial v}{\partial y}}=-{\frac {1}{\rho }}{\frac {\partial p}{\partial y}}+\nu \left({\frac {\partial ^{2}v}{\partial x^{2}}}+{\frac {\partial ^{2}v}{\partial y^{2}}}\right)+f_{y}(x,y,t)} ∂ u ∂ x + ∂ v ∂ y = 0 {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial u}{\partial x}}+{\frac {\partial v}{\partial y}}=0} ∂ v ∂ x + ∂ u ∂ y = 0 {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial v}{\partial x}}+{\frac {\partial u}{\partial y}}=0} where ρ {\displaystyle \rho } is the density, ν {\displaystyle \nu } is the kinematic viscosity, and f ( x , y , t ) = ( f x ( x , y , t ) , f y ( x , y , t ) ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {f} (x,y,t)=(f_{x}(x,y,t),f_{y}(x,y,t))} is an external force. The boundary conditions might specify that the velocity is fixed at the walls of the domain, or that the pressure is fixed at certain points. The last identity occurs because the flow is solenoidal . To solve these equations numerically, we can divide the domain into a series of smaller elements, and solve the equations locally within each element. For example, using a finite element method, we might represent the velocity and pressure fields as: u ( x , y , t ) = ∑ i = 1 N U i ( t ) ϕ i ( x , y ) {\displaystyle u(x,y,t)=\sum _{i=1}^{N}U_{i}(t)\phi _{i}(x,y)} v ( x , y , t ) = ∑ i = 1 N V i ( t ) ϕ i ( x , y ) {\displaystyle v(x,y,t)=\sum _{i=1}^{N}V_{i}(t)\phi _{i}(x,y)} p ( x , y , t ) = ∑ i = 1 N P i ( t ) ϕ i ( x , y ) {\displaystyle p(x,y,t)=\sum _{i=1}^{N}P_{i}(t)\phi _{i}(x,y)} where N {\displaystyle N} is the number of elements, and ϕ i ( x , y ) {\displaystyle \phi _{i}(x,y)} are the shape functions associated with each element. Substituting these expressions into the Navier–Stokes equations and applying the finite element method, we can derive a system of ordinary differential equations Statement of the periodic problem [ edit ] Hypotheses [ edit ] The functions sought now are periodic in the space variables of period 1. More precisely, let e i {\displaystyle e_{i}} be the unitary vector in the i - direction: e 1 = ( 1 , 0 , 0 ) , e 2 = ( 0 , 1 , 0 ) , e 3 = ( 0 , 0 , 1 ) {\displaystyle e_{1}=(1,0,0)\,,\qquad e_{2}=(0,1,0)\,,\qquad e_{3}=(0,0,1)} Then v ( x , t ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} (x,t)} is periodic in the space variables if for any i = 1 , 2 , 3 {\displaystyle i=1,2,3} , then: v ( x + e i , t ) = v ( x , t ) for all ( x , t ) ∈ R 3 × [ 0 , ∞ ) . {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} (x+e_{i},t)=\mathbf {v} (x,t){\text{ for all }}(x,t)\in \mathbb {R} ^{3}\times [0,\infty ).} Notice that this is considering the coordinates mod 1 . This allows working not on the whole space R 3 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}} but on the quotient space R 3 / Z 3 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}/\mathbb {Z} ^{3}} , which turns out to be the 3-dimensional torus: T 3 = { ( θ 1 , θ 2 , θ 3 ) : 0 ≤ θ i < 2 π , i = 1 , 2 , 3 } . {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} ^{3}=\{(\theta _{1},\theta _{2},\theta _{3}):0\leq \theta _{i}<2\pi \,,\quad i=1,2,3\}.} Now the hypotheses can be stated properly. The initial condition v 0 ( x ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{0}(x)} is assumed to be a smooth and divergence-free function and the external force f ( x , t ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {f} (x,t)} is assumed to be a smooth function as well. The type of solutions that are physically relevant are those who satisfy these conditions: v ( x , t ) ∈ C ∞ ( T 3 × [ 0 , ∞ ) ) , p ( x , t ) ∈ C ∞ ( T 3 × [ 0 , ∞ ) ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} (x,t)\in C^{\infty }(\mathbb {T} ^{3}\times [0,\infty )),\qquad p(x,t)\in C^{\infty }(\mathbb {T} ^{3}\times [0,\infty ))} There exists a constant E ∈ ( 0 , ∞ ) {\displaystyle E\in (0,\infty )} such that ∫ T 3 | v ( x , t ) | 2 d x < E {\displaystyle \int _{\mathbb {T} ^{3}}\vert \mathbf {v} (x,t)\vert ^{2}\,dx<E} for all t ≥ 0 . {\displaystyle t\geq 0\,.} Just as in the previous case, condition 3 implies that the functions are smooth and globally defined and condition 4 means that the kinetic energy of the solution is globally bounded. The periodic Millennium Prize theorems [ edit ] (C) Existence and smoothness of the Navier–Stokes solutions in T 3 {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} ^{3}} Let f ( x , t ) ≡ 0 {\displaystyle \mathbf {f} (x,t)\equiv 0} . For any initial condition v 0 ( x ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{0}(x)} satisfying the above hypotheses there exist smooth and globally defined solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations, i.e. there is a velocity vector v ( x , t ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} (x,t)} and a pressure p ( x , t ) {\displaystyle p(x,t)} satisfying conditions 3 and 4 above. (D) Breakdown of the Navier–Stokes solutions in T 3 {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} ^{3}} There exists an initial condition v 0 ( x ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{0}(x)} and an external force f ( x , t ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {f} (x,t)} such that there exists no solutions v ( x , t ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} (x,t)} and p ( x , t ) {\displaystyle p(x,t)} satisfying conditions 3 and 4 above. Partial results [ edit ] Finite difference method proved to be convergent for the Navier–Stokes equations and the equations are numerically solved by the 1960s. It is proved that there are smooth and globally defined solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations in 2 dimensions. [2] If the initial velocity v 0 ( x ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{0}(x)} is sufficiently small then the statement is true: there are smooth and globally defined solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations. [1] Given an initial velocity v 0 ( x ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{0}(x)} there exists a finite time T , depending on v 0 ( x ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{0}(x)} such that the Navier–Stokes equations on R 3 × ( 0 , T ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}\times (0,T)} have smooth solutions v ( x , t ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} (x,t)} and p ( x , t ) {\displaystyle p(x,t)} . It is not known if the solutions exist beyond that ""blowup time"" T . [1] Jean Leray in 1934 proved the existence of so-called weak solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations, satisfying the equations in mean value, not pointwise. [3] Terence Tao in 2016 published a finite time blowup result for an averaged version of the 3-dimensional Navier–Stokes equation. He writes that the result formalizes a ""supercriticality barrier"" for the global regularity problem for the true Navier–Stokes equations, and claims that the method of proof hints at a possible route to establishing blowup for the true equations. [4] In popular culture [ edit ] Unsolved problems have been used to indicate a rare mathematical talent in fiction. The Navier–Stokes problem features in The Mathematician's Shiva (2014), a book about a prestigious, deceased, fictional mathematician named Rachela Karnokovitch taking the proof to her grave in protest of academia. [5] [6] The movie Gifted (2017) referenced the Millennium Prize problems and dealt with the potential for a 7-year-old girl and her deceased mathematician mother for solving the Navier–Stokes problem.

Lens design [ edit ] The Stokes lens also known as variable power cross cylinder lens, in its standard version, is a lens combination consisted of equal but opposite (one plano-convex and other plano-concave) power cylindrical lenses attached together in a way so that the lenses be rotated in opposite directions. [2] [3] When the axes are parallel, the two powers cancel each other out to achieve the resulting power zero; When the axes are vertical, a sphero-cylindrical lens with maximum power is obtained. [3] Uses [ edit ] Stokes lens is a lens used to diagnose and measure astigmatism. [4] [5] Adaptations [ edit ] American ophthalmologist Edward Jackson revised the Stokes lens concept and made a cross cylinder lens to refine power and axis of astigmatism. [2] This lens combination is known as Jackson cross cylinder . [2] Based on the Stokes lens, James P. Foley and Charles E. Campbell made a variable power astigmatic lens which is combination of two identical cylindrical powers instead of equal and opposite powers. [2] [6] History [ edit ] In 1837, English mathematician and astronomer George Biddell Airy invented the cylindric lens and used it to correct astigmatism. [3] Irish English physicist and mathematician George Stokes invented Stokes lens in 1849. [3] References [ edit ] ^ Ferrer-Altabás, Sara; Micó, Vicente (10 April 2020).

Diagram of the Stokes shift between absorption and emission light spectra Stokes shift is the difference (in energy , wavenumber or frequency units) between positions of the band maxima of the absorption and emission spectra ( fluorescence and Raman being two examples) of the same electronic transition. [1] It is named after Irish physicist George Gabriel Stokes . [2] [3] [4] For Stokes (left), the molecule is excited from a vibrational energy level (v=0) to a virtual state (j). The Stokes scattering shows that the emitted energy is less than the absorbed. The anti-Stokes (right) shows that emitted energy is more than the absorbed. When a system (be it a molecule or atom ) absorbs a photon , it gains energy and enters an excited state . The system can relax by emitting a photon. The Stokes shift occurs when the energy of the emitted photon is lower than that of the absorbed photon, representing the difference in energy of the two photons. The Stokes shift is primarily the result of two phenomena: vibrational relaxation or dissipation and solvent reorganization. A fluorophore is a part of a molecule with a dipole moment that exhibits fluorescence. When a fluorophore enters an excited state, its dipole moment changes, but surrounding solvent molecules cannot adjust so quickly. Only after vibrational relaxation do their dipole moments realign. [5] Stokes shifts are given in wavelength units, but this is less meaningful than energy, wavenumber or frequency units because it depends on the absorption wavelength. For instance, a 50 nm Stokes shift from absorption at 300 nm is larger in terms of energy than a 50 nm Stokes shift from absorption at 600 nm. Stokes fluorescence [ edit ] Absorption and emission spectra of rhodamine 6G with ~25 nm Stokes shift Stokes fluorescence is the emission of a longer-wavelength photon (lower frequency or energy) by a molecule that has absorbed a photon of shorter wavelength (higher frequency or energy). [6] [7] [8] Both absorption and radiation (emission) of energy are distinctive for a particular molecular structure. If a material has a direct bandgap in the range of visible light, the light shining on it is absorbed, which excites electrons to a higher-energy state. The electrons remain in the excited state for about 10 −8 seconds. This number varies over several orders of magnitude, depending on the sample, and is known as the fluorescence lifetime of the sample. After losing a small amount of energy through vibrational relaxation, the molecule returns to the ground state, and energy is emitted. Anti-Stokes shift [ edit ] If the emitted photon has more energy than the absorbed photon, the energy difference is called an anti-Stokes shift ; [9] this extra energy comes from dissipation of thermal phonons in a crystal lattice, cooling the crystal in the process. Anti-Stokes shifts may also be due to triplet-triplet annihilation processes, resulting in the formation of higher singlet states that emit at higher energies. Applications of Stokes and anti-Stokes shifts [ edit ] Raman spectroscopy [ edit ] In Raman spectroscopy , when a molecule is excited by incident radiation, it undergoes a Stokes shift as it emits radiation at a lower energy level than the incident radiation. Analyzing the intensity and frequency of the spectral shift provides valuable information about the vibrational modes of molecules, enabling the identification of chemical bonds, functional groups, and molecular conformations. Yttrium oxysulfide [ edit ] Yttrium oxysulfide ( Y 2 O 2 S ) doped with gadolinium oxysulfide ( Gd 2 O 2 S ) is a common industrial anti-Stokes pigment , absorbing in the near-infrared and emitting in the visible region of the spectrum. [10] This composite material is often utilized in luminescent applications, where it absorbs lower-energy photons and emits higher-energy photons. This unique property makes it particularly valuable in various technological fields, including security printing, anti-counterfeiting measures, and luminescent displays. By harnessing anti-Stokes fluorescence, this pigment enables the creation of vibrant and durable inks, coatings, and materials with enhanced visibility and authentication capabilities. Photon upconversion [ edit ] Photon upconversion is an anti-Stokes process where lower-energy photons are converted into higher-energy photons. An example of this later process is demonstrated by upconverting nanoparticles . It is more commonly observed in Raman spectroscopy , where it can be used to determine the temperature of a material. [11] Optoelectronic devices [ edit ] In direct-bandgap thin-film semiconducting layers Stokes shifted emission can originate from three main sources: doping, strain, and disorder. [12] Each of these factors can introduce variations in the energy levels of the semiconductor material, leading to a shift in the emitted light towards longer wavelengths compared to the incident light. This phenomenon is particularly relevant in optoelectronic devices where controlling these factors can be crucial for optimizing device performance.

They were defined by George Gabriel Stokes in 1852, [1] [2] as a mathematically convenient alternative to the more common description of incoherent or partially polarized radiation in terms of its total intensity ( I ), (fractional) degree of polarization ( p ), and the shape parameters of the polarization ellipse . The effect of an optical system on the polarization of light can be determined by constructing the Stokes vector for the input light and applying Mueller calculus , to obtain the Stokes vector of the light leaving the system. They can be determined from directly observable phenomena. The original Stokes paper was discovered independently by Francis Perrin in 1942 [3] and by Subrahamanyan Chandrasekhar in 1947, [4] [5] who named it as the Stokes parameters. Definitions [ edit ] Polarisation ellipse, showing the relationship to the Poincaré sphere parameters ψ and χ. The Poincaré sphere is the parametrisation of the last three Stokes' parameters in spherical coordinates . Depiction of the polarization states on Poincaré sphere The relationship of the Stokes parameters S 0 , S 1 , S 2 , S 3 to intensity and polarization ellipse parameters is shown in the equations below and the figure on the right. S 0 = I S 1 = I p cos ⁡ 2 ψ cos ⁡ 2 χ S 2 = I p sin ⁡ 2 ψ cos ⁡ 2 χ S 3 = I p sin ⁡ 2 χ {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}S_{0}&=I\\S_{1}&=Ip\cos 2\psi \cos 2\chi \\S_{2}&=Ip\sin 2\psi \cos 2\chi \\S_{3}&=Ip\sin 2\chi \end{aligned}}} Here I p {\displaystyle Ip} , 2 ψ {\displaystyle 2\psi } and 2 χ {\displaystyle 2\chi } are the spherical coordinates of the three-dimensional vector of cartesian coordinates ( S 1 , S 2 , S 3 ) {\displaystyle (S_{1},S_{2},S_{3})} . I {\displaystyle I} is the total intensity of the beam, and p {\displaystyle p} is the degree of polarization, constrained by 0 ≤ p ≤ 1 {\displaystyle 0\leq p\leq 1} . The factor of two before ψ {\displaystyle \psi } represents the fact that any polarization ellipse is indistinguishable from one rotated by 180°, while the factor of two before χ {\displaystyle \chi } indicates that an ellipse is indistinguishable from one with the semi-axis lengths swapped accompanied by a 90° rotation. The phase information of the polarized light is not recorded in the Stokes parameters. The four Stokes parameters are sometimes denoted I , Q , U and V , respectively. Given the Stokes parameters, one can solve for the spherical coordinates with the following equations: I = S 0 p = S 1 2 + S 2 2 + S 3 2 S 0 2 ψ = a r c t a n S 2 S 1 2 χ = a r c t a n S 3 S 1 2 + S 2 2 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}I&=S_{0}\\p&={\frac {\sqrt {S_{1}^{2}+S_{2}^{2}+S_{3}^{2}}}{S_{0}}}\\2\psi &=\mathrm {arctan} {\frac {S_{2}}{S_{1}}}\\2\chi &=\mathrm {arctan} {\frac {S_{3}}{\sqrt {S_{1}^{2}+S_{2}^{2}}}}\\\end{aligned}}} Stokes vectors [ edit ] The Stokes parameters are often combined into a vector, known as the Stokes vector : S → = ( S 0 S 1 S 2 S 3 ) = ( I Q U V ) {\displaystyle {\vec {S}}\ ={\begin{pmatrix}S_{0}\\S_{1}\\S_{2}\\S_{3}\end{pmatrix}}={\begin{pmatrix}I\\Q\\U\\V\end{pmatrix}}} The Stokes vector spans the space of unpolarized, partially polarized, and fully polarized light. For comparison, the Jones vector only spans the space of fully polarized light, but is more useful for problems involving coherent light. The four Stokes parameters are not a preferred coordinate system of the space, but rather were chosen because they can be easily measured or calculated. Note that there is an ambiguous sign for the V {\displaystyle V} component depending on the physical convention used. In practice, there are two separate conventions used, either defining the Stokes parameters when looking down the beam towards the source (opposite the direction of light propagation) or looking down the beam away from the source (coincident with the direction of light propagation). These two conventions result in different signs for V {\displaystyle V} , and a convention must be chosen and adhered to. Examples [ edit ] Below are shown some Stokes vectors for common states of polarization of light. ( 1 1 0 0 ) {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1\\1\\0\\0\end{pmatrix}}} Linearly polarized (horizontal) ( 1 − 1 0 0 ) {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1\\-1\\0\\0\end{pmatrix}}} Linearly polarized (vertical) ( 1 0 1 0 ) {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1\\0\\1\\0\end{pmatrix}}} Linearly polarized (+45°) ( 1 0 − 1 0 ) {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1\\0\\-1\\0\end{pmatrix}}} Linearly polarized (−45°) ( 1 0 0 1 ) {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1\\0\\0\\1\end{pmatrix}}} Right-hand circularly polarized ( 1 0 0 − 1 ) {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1\\0\\0\\-1\end{pmatrix}}} Left-hand circularly polarized ( 1 0 0 0 ) {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1\\0\\0\\0\end{pmatrix}}} Unpolarized Alternative explanation [ edit ] A monochromatic plane wave is specified by its propagation vector , k → {\displaystyle {\vec {k}}} , and the complex amplitudes of the electric field , E 1 {\displaystyle E_{1}} and E 2 {\displaystyle E_{2}} , in a basis ( ϵ ^ 1 , ϵ ^ 2 ) {\displaystyle ({\hat {\epsilon }}_{1},{\hat {\epsilon }}_{2})} . The pair ( E 1 , E 2 ) {\displaystyle (E_{1},E_{2})} is called a Jones vector . Alternatively, one may specify the propagation vector, the phase , ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } , and the polarization state, Ψ {\displaystyle \Psi } , where Ψ {\displaystyle \Psi } is the curve traced out by the electric field as a function of time in a fixed plane. The most familiar polarization states are linear and circular, which are degenerate cases of the most general state, an ellipse . One way to describe polarization is by giving the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the polarization ellipse, its orientation, and the direction of rotation (See the above figure). The Stokes parameters I {\displaystyle I} , Q {\displaystyle Q} , U {\displaystyle U} , and V {\displaystyle V} , provide an alternative description of the polarization state which is experimentally convenient because each parameter corresponds to a sum or difference of measurable intensities. The next figure shows examples of the Stokes parameters in degenerate states. Definitions [ edit ] The Stokes parameters are defined by [ citation needed ] I ≡ ⟨ E x 2 ⟩ + ⟨ E y 2 ⟩ = ⟨ E a 2 ⟩ + ⟨ E b 2 ⟩ = ⟨ E r 2 ⟩ + ⟨ E l 2 ⟩ , Q ≡ ⟨ E x 2 ⟩ − ⟨ E y 2 ⟩ , U ≡ ⟨ E a 2 ⟩ − ⟨ E b 2 ⟩ , V ≡ ⟨ E r 2 ⟩ − ⟨ E l 2 ⟩ . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}I&\equiv \langle E_{x}^{2}\rangle +\langle E_{y}^{2}\rangle \\&=\langle E_{a}^{2}\rangle +\langle E_{b}^{2}\rangle \\&=\langle E_{r}^{2}\rangle +\langle E_{l}^{2}\rangle ,\\Q&\equiv \langle E_{x}^{2}\rangle -\langle E_{y}^{2}\rangle ,\\U&\equiv \langle E_{a}^{2}\rangle -\langle E_{b}^{2}\rangle ,\\V&\equiv \langle E_{r}^{2}\rangle -\langle E_{l}^{2}\rangle .\end{aligned}}} where the subscripts refer to three different bases of the space of Jones vectors : the standard Cartesian basis ( x ^ , y ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {x}},{\hat {y}}} ), a Cartesian basis rotated by 45° ( a ^ , b ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {a}},{\hat {b}}} ), and a circular basis ( l ^ , r ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {l}},{\hat {r}}} ). The circular basis is defined so that l ^ = ( x ^ + i y ^ ) / 2 {\displaystyle {\hat {l}}=({\hat {x}}+i{\hat {y}})/{\sqrt {2}}} , r ^ = ( x ^ − i y ^ ) / 2 {\displaystyle {\hat {r}}=({\hat {x}}-i{\hat {y}})/{\sqrt {2}}} . The symbols ⟨⋅⟩ represent expectation values . The light can be viewed as a random variable taking values in the space C 2 of Jones vectors ( E 1 , E 2 ) {\displaystyle (E_{1},E_{2})} . Any given measurement yields a specific wave (with a specific phase, polarization ellipse, and magnitude), but it keeps flickering and wobbling between different outcomes. The expectation values are various averages of these outcomes. Intense, but unpolarized light will have I > 0 but Q = U = V = 0, reflecting that no polarization type predominates. A convincing waveform is depicted at the article on coherence . The opposite would be perfectly polarized light which, in addition, has a fixed, nonvarying amplitude—a pure sine curve. This is represented by a random variable with only a single possible value, say ( E 1 , E 2 ) {\displaystyle (E_{1},E_{2})} . In this case one may replace the brackets by absolute value bars, obtaining a well-defined quadratic map [ citation needed ] I ≡ | E x | 2 + | E y | 2 = | E a | 2 + | E b | 2 = | E r | 2 + | E l | 2 Q ≡ | E x | 2 − | E y | 2 , U ≡ | E a | 2 − | E b | 2 , V ≡ | E r | 2 − | E l | 2 . {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}I\equiv |E_{x}|^{2}+|E_{y}|^{2}=|E_{a}|^{2}+|E_{b}|^{2}=|E_{r}|^{2}+|E_{l}|^{2}\\Q\equiv |E_{x}|^{2}-|E_{y}|^{2},\\U\equiv |E_{a}|^{2}-|E_{b}|^{2},\\V\equiv |E_{r}|^{2}-|E_{l}|^{2}.\end{matrix}}} from the Jones vectors to the corresponding Stokes vectors; more convenient forms are given below. The map takes its image in the cone defined by | I | 2 = | Q | 2 + | U | 2 + | V | 2 , where the purity of the state satisfies p = 1 (see below). The next figure shows how the signs of the Stokes parameters are determined by the helicity and the orientation of the semi-major axis of the polarization ellipse. Representations in fixed bases [ edit ] In a fixed ( x ^ , y ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {x}},{\hat {y}}} ) basis, the Stokes parameters when using an increasing phase convention are I = | E x | 2 + | E y | 2 , Q = | E x | 2 − | E y | 2 , U = 2 R e ( E x E y ∗ ) , V = − 2 I m ( E x E y ∗ ) , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}I&=|E_{x}|^{2}+|E_{y}|^{2},\\Q&=|E_{x}|^{2}-|E_{y}|^{2},\\U&=2\mathrm {Re} (E_{x}E_{y}^{*}),\\V&=-2\mathrm {Im} (E_{x}E_{y}^{*}),\\\end{aligned}}} while for ( a ^ , b ^ ) {\displaystyle ({\hat {a}},{\hat {b}})} , they are I = | E a | 2 + | E b | 2 , Q = − 2 R e ( E a ∗ E b ) , U = | E a | 2 − | E b | 2 , V = 2 I m ( E a ∗ E b ) . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}I&=|E_{a}|^{2}+|E_{b}|^{2},\\Q&=-2\mathrm {Re} (E_{a}^{*}E_{b}),\\U&=|E_{a}|^{2}-|E_{b}|^{2},\\V&=2\mathrm {Im} (E_{a}^{*}E_{b}).\\\end{aligned}}} and for ( l ^ , r ^ ) {\displaystyle ({\hat {l}},{\hat {r}})} , they are I = | E l | 2 + | E r | 2 , Q = 2 R e ( E l ∗ E r ) , U = − 2 I m ( E l ∗ E r ) , V = | E r | 2 − | E l | 2 . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}I&=|E_{l}|^{2}+|E_{r}|^{2},\\Q&=2\mathrm {Re} (E_{l}^{*}E_{r}),\\U&=-2\mathrm {Im} (E_{l}^{*}E_{r}),\\V&=|E_{r}|^{2}-|E_{l}|^{2}.\\\end{aligned}}} Properties [ edit ] For purely monochromatic coherent radiation, it follows from the above equations that Q 2 + U 2 + V 2 = I 2 , {\displaystyle Q^{2}+U^{2}+V^{2}=I^{2},} whereas for the whole (non-coherent) beam radiation, the Stokes parameters are defined as averaged quantities, and the previous equation becomes an inequality: [6] Q 2 + U 2 + V 2 ≤ I 2 . {\displaystyle Q^{2}+U^{2}+V^{2}\leq I^{2}.} However, we can define a total polarization intensity I p {\displaystyle I_{p}} , so that Q 2 + U 2 + V 2 = I p 2 , {\displaystyle Q^{2}+U^{2}+V^{2}=I_{p}^{2},} where I p / I {\displaystyle I_{p}/I} is the total polarization fraction. Let us define the complex intensity of linear polarization to be L ≡ | L | e i 2 θ ≡ Q + i U . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}L&\equiv |L|e^{i2\theta }\\&\equiv Q+iU.\\\end{aligned}}} Under a rotation θ → θ + θ ′ {\displaystyle \theta \rightarrow \theta +\theta '} of the polarization ellipse, it can be shown that I {\displaystyle I} and V {\displaystyle V} are invariant, but L → e i 2 θ ′ L , Q → Re ( e i 2 θ ′ L ) , U → Im ( e i 2 θ ′ L ) . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}L&\rightarrow e^{i2\theta '}L,\\Q&\rightarrow {\mbox{Re}}\left(e^{i2\theta '}L\right),\\U&\rightarrow {\mbox{Im}}\left(e^{i2\theta '}L\right).\\\end{aligned}}} With these properties, the Stokes parameters may be thought of as constituting three generalized intensities: I ≥ 0 , V ∈ R , L ∈ C , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}I&\geq 0,\\V&\in \mathbb {R} ,\\L&\in \mathbb {C} ,\\\end{aligned}}} where I {\displaystyle I} is the total intensity, | V | {\displaystyle |V|} is the intensity of circular polarization, and | L | {\displaystyle |L|} is the intensity of linear polarization. The total intensity of polarization is I p = | L | 2 + | V | 2 {\displaystyle I_{p}={\sqrt {|L|^{2}+|V|^{2}}}} , and the orientation and sense of rotation are given by θ = 1 2 arg ⁡ ( L ) , h = sgn ⁡ ( V ) . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\theta &={\frac {1}{2}}\arg(L),\\h&=\operatorname {sgn}(V).\\\end{aligned}}} Since Q = Re ( L ) {\displaystyle Q={\mbox{Re}}(L)} and U = Im ( L ) {\displaystyle U={\mbox{Im}}(L)} , we have | L | = Q 2 + U 2 , θ = 1 2 tan − 1 ⁡ ( U / Q ) . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}|L|&={\sqrt {Q^{2}+U^{2}}},\\\theta &={\frac {1}{2}}\tan ^{-1}(U/Q).\\\end{aligned}}} Relation to the polarization ellipse [ edit ] In terms of the parameters of the polarization ellipse, the Stokes parameters are I p = A 2 + B 2 , Q = ( A 2 − B 2 ) cos ⁡ ( 2 θ ) , U = ( A 2 − B 2 ) sin ⁡ ( 2 θ ) , V = 2 A B h . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}I_{p}&=A^{2}+B^{2},\\Q&=(A^{2}-B^{2})\cos(2\theta ),\\U&=(A^{2}-B^{2})\sin(2\theta ),\\V&=2ABh.\\\end{aligned}}} Inverting the previous equation gives A = 1 2 ( I p + | L | ) B = 1 2 ( I p − | L | ) θ = 1 2 arg ⁡ ( L ) h = sgn ⁡ ( V ) . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}A&={\sqrt {{\frac {1}{2}}(I_{p}+|L|)}}\\B&={\sqrt {{\frac {1}{2}}(I_{p}-|L|)}}\\\theta &={\frac {1}{2}}\arg(L)\\h&=\operatorname {sgn}(V).\\\end{aligned}}} Measurement [ edit ] The Stokes parameters (and thus the polarization of some electromagnetic radiation) can be directly determined from observation. [7] Using a linear polarizer and a quarter-wave plate , the following system of equations relating the Stokes parameters to measured intensity can be obtained: [8] I l ( 0 ) = 1 2 ( I + Q ) I l ( π 4 ) = 1 2 ( I + U ) I l ( π 2 ) = 1 2 ( I − Q ) I q ( π 4 ) = 1 2 ( I + V ) , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}I_{l}(0)&={\frac {1}{2}}(I+Q)\\I_{l}({\frac {\pi }{4}})&={\frac {1}{2}}(I+U)\\I_{l}({\frac {\pi }{2}})&={\frac {1}{2}}(I-Q)\\I_{q}({\frac {\pi }{4}})&={\frac {1}{2}}(I+V),\\\end{aligned}}} where I l ( θ ) {\displaystyle I_{l}(\theta )} is the irradiance of the radiation at a point when the linear polarizer is rotated at an angle of θ {\displaystyle \theta } , and similarly I q ( θ ) {\displaystyle I_{q}(\theta )} is the irradiance at a point when the quarter-wave plate is rotated at an angle of θ {\displaystyle \theta } . A system can be implemented using both plates at once at different angles to measure the parameters. This can give a more accurate measure of the relative magnitudes of the parameters (which is often the main result desired) due to all parameters being affected by the same losses. Relationship to Hermitian operators and quantum mixed states [ edit ] From a geometric and algebraic point of view, the Stokes parameters stand in one-to-one correspondence with the closed, convex, 4-real-dimensional cone of nonnegative Hermitian operators on the Hilbert space C 2 . The parameter I serves as the trace of the operator, whereas the entries of the matrix of the operator are simple linear functions of the four parameters I , Q , U , V , serving as coefficients in a linear combination of the Stokes operators . The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator can be calculated from the polarization ellipse parameters I , p , ψ , χ . The Stokes parameters with I set equal to 1 (i.e. the trace 1 operators) are in one-to-one correspondence with the closed unit 3-dimensional ball of mixed states (or density operators ) of the quantum space C 2 , whose boundary is the Bloch sphere . The Jones vectors correspond to the underlying space C 2 , that is, the (unnormalized) pure states of the same system. Note that the overall phase (i.e. the common phase factor between the two component waves on the two perpendicular polarization axes) is lost when passing from a pure state |φ⟩ to the corresponding mixed state |φ⟩⟨φ|, just as it is lost when passing from a Jones vector to the corresponding Stokes vector. In the basis of horizontal polarization state | H ⟩ {\displaystyle |H\rangle } and vertical polarization state | V ⟩ {\displaystyle |V\rangle } , the +45° linear polarization state is | + ⟩ = 1 2 ( | H ⟩ + | V ⟩ ) {\displaystyle |+\rangle ={\frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}}(|H\rangle +|V\rangle )} , the -45° linear polarization state is | − ⟩ = 1 2 ( | H ⟩ − | V ⟩ ) {\displaystyle |-\rangle ={\frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}}(|H\rangle -|V\rangle )} , the left hand circular polarization state is | L ⟩ = 1 2 ( | H ⟩ + i | V ⟩ ) {\displaystyle |L\rangle ={\frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}}(|H\rangle +i|V\rangle )} , and the right hand circular polarization state is | R ⟩ = 1 2 ( | H ⟩ − i | V ⟩ ) {\displaystyle |R\rangle ={\frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}}(|H\rangle -i|V\rangle )} . It's easy to see that these states are the eigenvectors of Pauli matrices , and that the normalized Stokes parameters ( U/I , V/I , Q/I ) correspond to the coordinates of the Bloch vector ( a x {\displaystyle a_{x}} , a y {\displaystyle a_{y}} , a z {\displaystyle a_{z}} ). Equivalently, we have U / I = t r ( ρ σ x ) {\displaystyle U/I=tr\left(\rho \sigma _{x}\right)} , V / I = t r ( ρ σ y ) {\displaystyle V/I=tr\left(\rho \sigma _{y}\right)} , Q / I = t r ( ρ σ z ) {\displaystyle Q/I=tr\left(\rho \sigma _{z}\right)} , where ρ {\displaystyle \rho } is the density matrix of the mixed state. Generally, a linear polarization at angle θ has a pure quantum state | θ ⟩ = cos ⁡ θ | H ⟩ + sin ⁡ θ | V ⟩ {\displaystyle |\theta \rangle =\cos {\theta }|H\rangle +\sin {\theta }|V\rangle } ; therefore, the transmittance of a linear polarizer/analyzer at angle θ for a mixed state light source with density matrix ρ = 1 2 ( I + a x σ x + a y σ y + a z σ z ) {\displaystyle \rho ={\frac {1}{2}}\left(I+a_{x}\sigma _{x}+a_{y}\sigma _{y}+a_{z}\sigma _{z}\right)} is t r ( ρ | θ ⟩ ⟨ θ | ) = 1 2 ( 1 + a x sin ⁡ 2 θ + a z cos ⁡ 2 θ ) {\displaystyle tr(\rho |\theta \rangle \langle \theta |)={\frac {1}{2}}\left(1+a_{x}\sin {2\theta }+a_{z}\cos {2\theta }\right)} , with a maximum transmittance of 1 2 ( 1 + a x 2 + a z 2 ) {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}(1+{\sqrt {a_{x}^{2}+a_{z}^{2}}})} at θ 0 = 1 2 arctan ⁡ ( a x / a z ) {\displaystyle \theta _{0}={\frac {1}{2}}\arctan {(a_{x}/a_{z})}} if a z > 0 {\displaystyle a_{z}>0} , or at θ 0 = 1 2 arctan ⁡ ( a x / a z ) + π 2 {\displaystyle \theta _{0}={\frac {1}{2}}\arctan {(a_{x}/a_{z})}+{\frac {\pi }{2}}} if a z < 0 {\displaystyle a_{z}<0} ; the minimum transmittance of 1 2 ( 1 − a x 2 + a z 2 ) {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}(1-{\sqrt {a_{x}^{2}+a_{z}^{2}}})} is reached at the perpendicular to the maximum transmittance direction. Here, the ratio of maximum transmittance to minimum transmittance is defined as the extinction ratio E R = ( 1 + D O L P ) / ( 1 − D O L P ) {\displaystyle ER=(1+DOLP)/(1-DOLP)} , where the degree of linear polarization is D O L P = a x 2 + a z 2 {\displaystyle DOLP={\sqrt {a_{x}^{2}+a_{z}^{2}}}} . Equivalently, the formula for the transmittance can be rewritten as A cos 2 ⁡ ( θ − θ 0 ) + B {\displaystyle A\cos ^{2}{(\theta -\theta _{0})}+B} , which is an extended form of Malus's law ; here, A , B {\displaystyle A,B} are both non-negative, and is related to the extinction ratio by E R = ( A + B ) / B {\displaystyle ER=(A+B)/B} . Two of the normalized Stokes parameters can also be calculated by a x = D O L P sin ⁡ 2 θ 0 , a z = D O L P cos ⁡ 2 θ 0 , D O L P = ( E R − 1 ) / ( E R + 1 ) {\displaystyle a_{x}=DOLP\sin {2\theta _{0}},\,a_{z}=DOLP\cos {2\theta _{0}},\,DOLP=(ER-1)/(ER+1)} . It's also worth noting that a rotation of polarization axis by angle θ corresponds to the Bloch sphere rotation operator R y ( 2 θ ) = [ cos ⁡ θ − sin ⁡ θ sin ⁡ θ cos ⁡ θ ] {\displaystyle R_{y}(2\theta )={\begin{bmatrix}\cos \theta &-\sin \theta \\\sin \theta &\cos \theta \end{bmatrix}}} . For example, the horizontal polarization state | H ⟩ {\displaystyle |H\rangle } would rotate to | θ ⟩ = cos ⁡ θ | H ⟩ + sin ⁡ θ | V ⟩ {\displaystyle |\theta \rangle =\cos {\theta }|H\rangle +\sin {\theta }|V\rangle } . The effect of a quarter-wave plate aligned to the horizontal axis is described by R z ( π / 2 ) = [ e − i π / 4 0 0 e + i π / 4 ] {\displaystyle R_{z}(\pi /2)={\begin{bmatrix}e^{-i\pi /4}&0\\0&e^{+i\pi /4}\end{bmatrix}}} , or equivalently the Phase gate S , and the resulting Bloch vector becomes ( − a y , a x , a z ) {\displaystyle (-a_{y},a_{x},a_{z})} . With this configuration, if we perform the rotating analyzer method to measure the extinction ratio, we will be able to calculate a y {\displaystyle a_{y}} and also verify a z {\displaystyle a_{z}} . For this method to work, the fast axis and the slow axis of the waveplate must be aligned with the reference directions for the basis states. The effect of a quarter-wave plate rotated by angle θ can be determined by Rodrigues' rotation formula as R n ( π / 2 ) = 1 2 I − i 1 2 ( n ^ ⋅ σ → ) {\displaystyle R_{n}(\pi /2)={\frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}}I-i{\frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}}({\hat {n}}\cdot {\vec {\sigma }})} , with n ^ = z ^ cos ⁡ 2 θ + x ^ sin ⁡ 2 θ {\displaystyle {\hat {n}}={\hat {z}}\cos {2\theta }+{\hat {x}}\sin {2\theta }} . The transmittance of the resulting light through a linear polarizer (analyzer plate) along the horizontal axis can be calculated using the same Rodrigues' rotation formula and focusing on its components on I {\displaystyle I} and σ z {\displaystyle \sigma _{z}} : T = t r [ R n ( π / 2 ) ρ R n ( − π / 2 ) | H ⟩ ⟨ H | ] = 1 2 [ 1 + a y sin ⁡ 2 θ + ( n ^ ⋅ a → ) cos ⁡ 2 θ ] = 1 2 [ 1 + a y sin ⁡ 2 θ + ( a x sin ⁡ 2 θ + a z cos ⁡ 2 θ ) cos ⁡ 2 θ ] = 1 2 ( 1 + a y sin ⁡ 2 θ + D O L P × cos ⁡ ( 4 θ − 2 θ 0 ) + cos ⁡ ( 2 θ 0 ) 2 ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}T&=tr[R_{n}(\pi /2)\rho R_{n}(-\pi /2)|H\rangle \langle H|]\\&={\frac {1}{2}}\left[1+a_{y}\sin {2\theta }+({\hat {n}}\cdot {\vec {a}})\cos {2\theta }\right]\\&={\frac {1}{2}}\left[1+a_{y}\sin {2\theta }+(a_{x}\sin {2\theta }+a_{z}\cos {2\theta })\cos {2\theta }\right]\\&={\frac {1}{2}}\left(1+a_{y}\sin {2\theta }+DOLP\times {\frac {\cos {(4\theta -2\theta _{0})}+\cos {(2\theta _{0})}}{2}}\right)\end{aligned}}} The above expression is the theory basis of many polarimeters. For unpolarized light , T=1/2 is a constant. For purely circularly polarized light, T has a sinusoidal dependence on angle θ with a period of 180 degrees, and can reach absolute extinction where T=0. For purely linearly polarized light, T has a sinusoidal dependence on angle θ with a period of 90 degrees, and absolute extinction is only reachable when the original light's polarization is at 90 degrees from the polarizer (i.e. a z = − 1 {\displaystyle a_{z}=-1} ). In this configuration, θ 0 = π 2 {\displaystyle \theta _{0}={\frac {\pi }{2}}} and T = 1 − cos ⁡ ( 4 θ ) 4 {\displaystyle T={\frac {1-\cos {(4\theta )}}{4}}} , with a maximum of 1/2 at θ=45°, and an extinction point at θ=0°. This result can be used to precisely determine the fast or slow axis of a quarter-wave plate, for example, by using a polarizing beam splitter to obtain a linearly polarized light aligned to the analyzer plate and rotating the quarter-wave plate in between. Similarly, the effect of a half-wave plate rotated by angle θ is described by R n ( π ) = − i ( n ^ ⋅ σ → ) {\displaystyle R_{n}(\pi )=-i({\hat {n}}\cdot {\vec {\sigma }})} , which transforms the density matrix to: R n ( π ) ρ R n ( − π ) = 1 2 ( I + a → ⋅ [ − σ → + 2 n ^ ( n ^ ⋅ σ → ) ] ) = 1 2 [ I − a → ⋅ σ → + 2 ( n ^ ⋅ a → ) ( n ^ ⋅ σ → ) ] {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}R_{n}(\pi )\rho R_{n}(-\pi )&={\frac {1}{2}}\left(I+{\vec {a}}\cdot [-{\vec {\sigma }}+2{\hat {n}}({\hat {n}}\cdot {\vec {\sigma }})]\right)\\&={\frac {1}{2}}\left[I-{\vec {a}}\cdot {\vec {\sigma }}+2({\hat {n}}\cdot {\vec {a}})({\hat {n}}\cdot {\vec {\sigma }})\right]\end{aligned}}} The above expression demonstrates that if the original light is of pure linear polarization (i.e. a y = 0 {\displaystyle a_{y}=0} ), the resulting light after the half-wave plate is still of pure linear polariztion (i.e. without σ y {\displaystyle \sigma _{y}} component) with a rotated major axis. Such rotation of the linear polarization has a sinusoidal dependence on angle θ with a period of 90 degrees.

Named after George Gabriel Stokes , it is closely related to solute mobility, factoring in not only size but also solvent effects. A smaller ion with stronger hydration, for example, may have a greater Stokes radius than a larger ion with weaker hydration. This is because the smaller ion drags a greater number of water molecules with it as it moves through the solution. [1] Stokes radius is sometimes used synonymously with effective hydrated radius in solution . [2] Hydrodynamic radius , R H , can refer to the Stokes radius of a polymer or other macromolecule. Spherical case [ edit ] According to Stokes’ law , a perfect sphere traveling through a viscous liquid feels a drag force proportional to the frictional coefficient f {\displaystyle f} : F drag = f s = ( 6 π η a ) s {\displaystyle F_{\text{drag}}=fs=(6\pi \eta a)s} where η {\displaystyle \eta } is the liquid's viscosity , s {\displaystyle s} is the sphere's drift speed , and a {\displaystyle a} is its radius. Because ionic mobility μ {\displaystyle \mu } is directly proportional to drift speed, it is inversely proportional to the frictional coefficient: μ = z e f {\displaystyle \mu ={\frac {ze}{f}}} where z e {\displaystyle ze} represents ionic charge in integer multiples of electron charges. In 1905, Albert Einstein found the diffusion coefficient D {\displaystyle D} of an ion to be proportional to its mobility constant: D = μ k B T q = k B T f {\displaystyle D={\frac {\mu k_{\text{B}}T}{q}}={\frac {k_{\text{B}}T}{f}}} where k B {\displaystyle k_{\text{B}}} is the Boltzmann constant and q {\displaystyle q} is electrical charge . This is known as the Einstein relation . Substituting in the frictional coefficient of a perfect sphere from Stokes’ law yields D = k B T 6 π η a {\displaystyle D={\frac {k_{\text{B}}T}{6\pi \eta a}}} which can be rearranged to solve for a {\displaystyle a} , the radius: R H = a = k B T 6 π η D {\displaystyle R_{H}=a={\frac {k_{\text{B}}T}{6\pi \eta D}}} In non-spherical systems, the frictional coefficient is determined by the size and shape of the species under consideration. Research applications [ edit ] Stokes radii are often determined experimentally by gel-permeation or gel-filtration chromatography. [3] [4] [5] [6] They are useful in characterizing biological species due to the size-dependence of processes like enzyme-substrate interaction and membrane diffusion. [5] The Stokes radii of sediment, soil, and aerosol particles are considered in ecological measurements and models. [7] They likewise play a role in the study of polymer and other macromolecular systems.

Streamlines around a sphere in axisymmetric Stokes flow . At terminal velocity the drag force F d balances the force F g propelling the object. In fluid dynamics , the Stokes stream function is used to describe the streamlines and flow velocity in a three-dimensional incompressible flow with axisymmetry . A surface with a constant value of the Stokes stream function encloses a streamtube , everywhere tangential to the flow velocity vectors. Further, the volume flux within this streamtube is constant, and all the streamlines of the flow are located on this surface. The velocity field associated with the Stokes stream function is solenoidal —it has zero divergence . This stream function is named in honor of George Gabriel Stokes . Cylindrical coordinates [ edit ] A point plotted with cylindrical coordinates. Consider a cylindrical coordinate system ( ρ , φ , z ), with the z –axis the line around which the incompressible flow is axisymmetrical, φ the azimuthal angle and ρ the distance to the z –axis. Then the flow velocity components u ρ and u z can be expressed in terms of the Stokes stream function Ψ {\displaystyle \Psi } by: [1] u ρ = − 1 ρ ∂ Ψ ∂ z , u z = + 1 ρ ∂ Ψ ∂ ρ . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}u_{\rho }&=-{\frac {1}{\rho }}\,{\frac {\partial \Psi }{\partial z}},\\u_{z}&=+{\frac {1}{\rho }}\,{\frac {\partial \Psi }{\partial \rho }}.\end{aligned}}} The azimuthal velocity component u φ does not depend on the stream function. Due to the axisymmetry, all three velocity components ( u ρ , u φ , u z ) only depend on ρ and z and not on the azimuth φ . The volume flux, through the surface bounded by a constant value ψ of the Stokes stream function, is equal to 2π ψ . Spherical coordinates [ edit ] A point plotted using the spherical coordinate system In spherical coordinates ( r , θ , φ ), r is the radial distance from the origin , θ is the zenith angle and φ is the azimuthal angle . In axisymmetric flow, with θ = 0 the rotational symmetry axis, the quantities describing the flow are again independent of the azimuth φ . The flow velocity components u r and u θ are related to the Stokes stream function Ψ {\displaystyle \Psi } through: [2] u r = + 1 r 2 sin ⁡ θ ∂ Ψ ∂ θ , u θ = − 1 r sin ⁡ θ ∂ Ψ ∂ r . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}u_{r}&=+{\frac {1}{r^{2}\,\sin \theta }}\,{\frac {\partial \Psi }{\partial \theta }},\\u_{\theta }&=-{\frac {1}{r\,\sin \theta }}\,{\frac {\partial \Psi }{\partial r}}.\end{aligned}}} Again, the azimuthal velocity component u φ is not a function of the Stokes stream function ψ . The volume flux through a stream tube, bounded by a surface of constant ψ , equals 2π ψ , as before. Vorticity [ edit ] See also: Stream_function § Vorticity The vorticity is defined as: ω = ∇ × u = ∇ × ∇ × ψ {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\omega }}=\nabla \times {\boldsymbol {u}}=\nabla \times \nabla \times {\boldsymbol {\psi }}} , where ψ = − Ψ r sin ⁡ θ ϕ ^ , {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\psi }}=-{\frac {\Psi }{r\sin \theta }}{\boldsymbol {\hat {\phi }}},} with ϕ ^ {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\hat {\phi }}}} the unit vector in the ϕ {\displaystyle \phi \,} –direction. Derivation of vorticity ω {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\omega }}} using a Stokes stream function Consider the vorticity as defined by ω = ∇ × u . {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\omega }}=\nabla \times {\boldsymbol {u}}.} From the definition of the curl in spherical coordinates : ω r = 1 r sin ⁡ θ ( ∂ ∂ θ ( u ϕ sin ⁡ θ ) − ∂ u θ ∂ ϕ ) r ^ , ω θ = 1 r ( 1 sin ⁡ θ ∂ u r ∂ ϕ − ∂ ∂ r ( r u ϕ ) ) θ ^ , ω ϕ = 1 r ( ∂ ∂ r ( r u θ ) − ∂ u r ∂ θ ) ϕ ^ . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\omega _{r}&={1 \over r\sin \theta }\left({\partial \over \partial \theta }\left(u_{\phi }\sin \theta \right)-{\partial u_{\theta } \over \partial \phi }\right){\boldsymbol {\hat {r}}},\\\omega _{\theta }&={1 \over r}\left({1 \over \sin \theta }{\partial u_{r} \over \partial \phi }-{\partial \over \partial r}\left(ru_{\phi }\right)\right){\boldsymbol {\hat {\theta }}},\\\omega _{\phi }&={1 \over r}\left({\partial \over \partial r}\left(ru_{\theta }\right)-{\partial u_{r} \over \partial \theta }\right){\boldsymbol {\hat {\phi }}}.\end{aligned}}} First notice that the r {\displaystyle r} and θ {\displaystyle \theta } components are equal to 0. Secondly substitute u r {\displaystyle u_{r}} and u θ {\displaystyle u_{\theta }} into ω ϕ . {\displaystyle \omega _{\phi }.} The result is: ω r = 0 , ω θ = 0 , ω ϕ = 1 r ( ∂ ∂ r ( r ( − 1 r sin ⁡ θ ∂ Ψ ∂ r ) ) − ∂ ∂ θ ( 1 r 2 sin ⁡ θ ∂ Ψ ∂ θ ) ) . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\omega _{r}&=0,\\\omega _{\theta }&=0,\\\omega _{\phi }&={1 \over r}\left({\partial \over \partial r}\left(r\left(-{\frac {1}{r\sin \theta }}{\frac {\partial \Psi }{\partial r}}\right)\right)-{\partial \over \partial \theta }\left({\frac {1}{r^{2}\sin \theta }}{\frac {\partial \Psi }{\partial \theta }}\right)\right).\end{aligned}}} Next the following algebra is performed: ω ϕ = 1 r ( − 1 sin ⁡ θ ( ∂ ∂ r ( ∂ Ψ ∂ r ) ) − 1 r 2 ∂ ∂ θ ( 1 sin ⁡ θ ∂ Ψ ∂ θ ) ) = 1 r ( − 1 sin ⁡ θ ( ∂ 2 Ψ ∂ r 2 ) − sin ⁡ θ r 2 sin ⁡ θ ∂ ∂ θ ( 1 sin ⁡ θ ∂ Ψ ∂ θ ) ) = − 1 r sin ⁡ θ ( ∂ 2 Ψ ∂ r 2 + sin ⁡ θ r 2 ∂ ∂ θ ( 1 sin ⁡ θ ∂ Ψ ∂ θ ) ) . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\omega _{\phi }&={1 \over r}\left(-{\frac {1}{\sin \theta }}\left({\partial \over \partial r}\left({\frac {\partial \Psi }{\partial r}}\right)\right)-{\frac {1}{r^{2}}}{\partial \over \partial \theta }\left({\frac {1}{\sin \theta }}{\frac {\partial \Psi }{\partial \theta }}\right)\right)\\&={1 \over r}\left(-{\frac {1}{\sin \theta }}\left({\frac {\partial ^{2}\Psi }{\partial r^{2}}}\right)-{\frac {\sin \theta }{r^{2}\sin \theta }}{\partial \over \partial \theta }\left({\frac {1}{\sin \theta }}{\frac {\partial \Psi }{\partial \theta }}\right)\right)\\&=-{\frac {1}{r\sin \theta }}\left({\frac {\partial ^{2}\Psi }{\partial r^{2}}}+{\frac {\sin \theta }{r^{2}}}{\partial \over \partial \theta }\left({\frac {1}{\sin \theta }}{\frac {\partial \Psi }{\partial \theta }}\right)\right).\end{aligned}}} As a result, from the calculation the vorticity vector is found to be equal to: ω = ( 0 0 − 1 r sin ⁡ θ ( ∂ 2 Ψ ∂ r 2 + sin ⁡ θ r 2 ∂ ∂ θ ( 1 sin ⁡ θ ∂ Ψ ∂ θ ) ) ) . {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\omega }}={\begin{pmatrix}0\\[1ex]0\\[1ex]\displaystyle -{\frac {1}{r\sin \theta }}\left({\frac {\partial ^{2}\Psi }{\partial r^{2}}}+{\frac {\sin \theta }{r^{2}}}{\partial \over \partial \theta }\left({\frac {1}{\sin \theta }}{\frac {\partial \Psi }{\partial \theta }}\right)\right)\end{pmatrix}}.} Comparison with cylindrical [ edit ] The cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems are related through z = r cos ⁡ θ {\displaystyle z=r\,\cos \theta \,} and ρ = r sin ⁡ θ . {\displaystyle \rho =r\,\sin \theta .\,} Alternative definition with opposite sign [ edit ] As explained in the general stream function article, definitions using an opposite sign convention – for the relationship between the Stokes stream function and flow velocity – are also in use. [3] Zero divergence [ edit ] In cylindrical coordinates, the divergence of the velocity field u becomes: [4] ∇ ⋅ u = 1 ρ ∂ ∂ ρ ( ρ u ρ ) + ∂ u z ∂ z = 1 ρ ∂ ∂ ρ ( − ∂ Ψ ∂ z ) + ∂ ∂ z ( 1 ρ ∂ Ψ ∂ ρ ) = 0 , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\nabla \cdot {\boldsymbol {u}}&={\frac {1}{\rho }}{\frac {\partial }{\partial \rho }}{\Bigl (}\rho \,u_{\rho }{\Bigr )}+{\frac {\partial u_{z}}{\partial z}}\\&={\frac {1}{\rho }}{\frac {\partial }{\partial \rho }}\left(-{\frac {\partial \Psi }{\partial z}}\right)+{\frac {\partial }{\partial z}}\left({\frac {1}{\rho }}{\frac {\partial \Psi }{\partial \rho }}\right)=0,\end{aligned}}} as expected for an incompressible flow.

If it is shown that everywhere u ⋅ ∇ Ψ = 0 , {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {u}}\cdot \nabla \Psi =0,} using the formula for u {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {u}}} in terms of Ψ , {\displaystyle \Psi ,} then this proves that level curves of Ψ {\displaystyle \Psi } are streamlines.

Stokes drift in shallow water waves, with a wave length much longer than the water depth. The red circles are the present positions of massless particles, moving with the flow velocity . The light-blue line gives the path of these particles, and the light-blue circles the particle position after each wave period . The white dots are fluid particles, also followed in time. In the cases shown here, the mean Eulerian horizontal velocity below the wave trough is zero. Observe that the wave period , experienced by a fluid particle near the free surface , is different from the wave period at a fixed horizontal position (as indicated by the light-blue circles). This is due to the Doppler shift . An expanse of driftwood along the northern coast of Washington state . Stokes drift – besides e.g. Ekman drift and geostrophic currents – is one of the relevant processes in the transport of marine debris . [1] For a pure wave motion in fluid dynamics , the Stokes drift velocity is the average velocity when following a specific fluid parcel as it travels with the fluid flow . For instance, a particle floating at the free surface of water waves , experiences a net Stokes drift velocity in the direction of wave propagation . More generally, the Stokes drift velocity is the difference between the average Lagrangian flow velocity of a fluid parcel, and the average Eulerian flow velocity of the fluid at a fixed position. This nonlinear phenomenon is named after George Gabriel Stokes , who derived expressions for this drift in his 1847 study of water waves . The Stokes drift is the difference in end positions, after a predefined amount of time (usually one wave period ), as derived from a description in the Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinates . The end position in the Lagrangian description is obtained by following a specific fluid parcel during the time interval. The corresponding end position in the Eulerian description is obtained by integrating the flow velocity at a fixed position—equal to the initial position in the Lagrangian description—during the same time interval. The Stokes drift velocity equals the Stokes drift divided by the considered time interval. Often, the Stokes drift velocity is loosely referred to as Stokes drift. Stokes drift may occur in all instances of oscillatory flow which are inhomogeneous in space. For instance in water waves , tides and atmospheric waves . In the Lagrangian description , fluid parcels may drift far from their initial positions. As a result, the unambiguous definition of an average Lagrangian velocity and Stokes drift velocity, which can be attributed to a certain fixed position, is by no means a trivial task. However, such an unambiguous description is provided by the Generalized Lagrangian Mean (GLM) theory of Andrews and McIntyre in 1978 . [2] The Stokes drift is important for the mass transfer of various kinds of material and organisms by oscillatory flows. It plays a crucial role in the generation of Langmuir circulations . [3] For nonlinear and periodic water waves, accurate results on the Stokes drift have been computed and tabulated. [4] Mathematical description [ edit ] The Lagrangian motion of a fluid parcel with position vector x = ξ ( α , t) in the Eulerian coordinates is given by [5] ξ ˙ = ∂ ξ ∂ t = u ( ξ ( α , t ) , t ) , {\displaystyle {\dot {\boldsymbol {\xi }}}={\frac {\partial {\boldsymbol {\xi }}}{\partial t}}=\mathbf {u} {\big (}{\boldsymbol {\xi }}({\boldsymbol {\alpha }},t),t{\big )},} where ∂ ξ /∂ t is the partial derivative of ξ ( α , t ) with respect to t , ξ ( α , t ) is the Lagrangian position vector of a fluid parcel, u ( x , t ) is the Eulerian velocity , x is the position vector in the Eulerian coordinate system , α is the position vector in the Lagrangian coordinate system , t is time . Often, the Lagrangian coordinates α are chosen to coincide with the Eulerian coordinates x at the initial time t = t 0 : [5] ξ ( α , t 0 ) = α . {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\xi }}({\boldsymbol {\alpha }},t_{0})={\boldsymbol {\alpha }}.} If the average value of a quantity is denoted by an overbar, then the average Eulerian velocity vector ū E and average Lagrangian velocity vector ū L are u ¯ E = u ( x , t ) ¯ , u ¯ L = ξ ˙ ( α , t ) ¯ = ( ∂ ξ ( α , t ) ∂ t ) ¯ = u ( ξ ( α , t ) , t ) ¯ . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\bar {\mathbf {u} }}_{\text{E}}&={\overline {\mathbf {u} (\mathbf {x} ,t)}},\\{\bar {\mathbf {u} }}_{\text{L}}&={\overline {{\dot {\boldsymbol {\xi }}}({\boldsymbol {\alpha }},t)}}={\overline {\left({\frac {\partial {\boldsymbol {\xi }}({\boldsymbol {\alpha }},t)}{\partial t}}\right)}}={\overline {{\boldsymbol {u}}{\big (}{\boldsymbol {\xi }}({\boldsymbol {\alpha }},t),t{\big )}}}.\end{aligned}}} Different definitions of the average may be used, depending on the subject of study (see ergodic theory ): time average, space average, ensemble average , phase average. The Stokes drift velocity ū S is defined as the difference between the average Eulerian velocity and the average Lagrangian velocity: [6] u ¯ S = u ¯ L − u ¯ E . {\displaystyle {\bar {\mathbf {u} }}_{\text{S}}={\bar {\mathbf {u} }}_{\text{L}}-{\bar {\mathbf {u} }}_{\text{E}}.} In many situations, the mapping of average quantities from some Eulerian position x to a corresponding Lagrangian position α forms a problem. Since a fluid parcel with label α traverses along a path of many different Eulerian positions x , it is not possible to assign α to a unique x . A mathematically sound basis for an unambiguous mapping between average Lagrangian and Eulerian quantities is provided by the theory of the generalized Lagrangian mean (GLM) by Andrews and McIntyre (1978) . Example: A one-dimensional compressible flow [ edit ] For the Eulerian velocity as a monochromatic wave of any nature in a continuous medium: u = u ^ sin ⁡ ( k x − ω t ) , {\displaystyle u={\hat {u}}\sin(kx-\omega t),} one readily obtains by the perturbation theory – with k u ^ / ω {\displaystyle k{\hat {u}}/\omega } as a small parameter – for the particle position x = ξ ( ξ 0 , t ) {\displaystyle x=\xi (\xi _{0},t)} : ξ ˙ = u ( ξ , t ) = u ^ sin ⁡ ( k ξ − ω t ) , {\displaystyle {\dot {\xi }}=u(\xi ,t)={\hat {u}}\sin(k\xi -\omega t),} ξ ( ξ 0 , t ) ≈ ξ 0 + u ^ ω cos ⁡ ( k ξ 0 − ω t ) − 1 4 k u ^ 2 ω 2 sin ⁡ 2 ( k ξ 0 − ω t ) + 1 2 k u ^ 2 ω t . {\displaystyle \xi (\xi _{0},t)\approx \xi _{0}+{\frac {\hat {u}}{\omega }}\cos(k\xi _{0}-\omega t)-{\frac {1}{4}}{\frac {k{\hat {u}}^{2}}{\omega ^{2}}}\sin 2(k\xi _{0}-\omega t)+{\frac {1}{2}}{\frac {k{\hat {u}}^{2}}{\omega }}t.} Here the last term describes the Stokes drift velocity 1 2 k u ^ 2 / ω . {\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{2}}k{\hat {u}}^{2}/\omega .} [7] Example: Deep water waves [ edit ] Stokes drift under periodic waves in deep water, for a period T = 5 s and a mean water depth of 25 m. Left : instantaneous horizontal flow velocities . Right : average flow velocities. Black solid line: average Eulerian velocity; red dashed line: average Lagrangian velocity, as derived from the Generalized Lagrangian Mean (GLM). See also: Airy wave theory and Stokes wave The Stokes drift was formulated for water waves by George Gabriel Stokes in 1847. For simplicity, the case of infinitely deep water is considered, with linear wave propagation of a sinusoidal wave on the free surface of a fluid layer: [8] η = a cos ⁡ ( k x − ω t ) , {\displaystyle \eta =a\cos(kx-\omega t),} where η is the elevation of the free surface in the z direction (meters), a is the wave amplitude (meters), k is the wave number : k = 2 π / λ ( radians per meter), ω is the angular frequency : ω = 2 π / T ( radians per second ), x is the horizontal coordinate and the wave propagation direction (meters), z is the vertical coordinate , with the positive z direction pointing out of the fluid layer (meters), λ is the wave length (meters), T is the wave period ( seconds ). As derived below, the horizontal component ū S ( z ) of the Stokes drift velocity for deep-water waves is approximately: [9] u ¯ S ≈ ω k a 2 e 2 k z = 4 π 2 a 2 λ T e 4 π z / λ . {\displaystyle {\bar {u}}_{\text{S}}\approx \omega ka^{2}{\text{e}}^{2kz}={\frac {4\pi ^{2}a^{2}}{\lambda T}}{\text{e}}^{4\pi z/\lambda }.} As can be seen, the Stokes drift velocity ū S is a nonlinear quantity in terms of the wave amplitude a . Further, the Stokes drift velocity decays exponentially with depth: at a depth of a quarter wavelength, z = − λ /4, it is about 4% of its value at the mean free surface , z = 0. Derivation [ edit ] It is assumed that the waves are of infinitesimal amplitude and the free surface oscillates around the mean level z = 0. The waves propagate under the action of gravity, with a constant acceleration vector by gravity (pointing downward in the negative z direction). Further the fluid is assumed to be inviscid [10] and incompressible , with a constant mass density . The fluid flow is irrotational . At infinite depth, the fluid is taken to be at rest . Now the flow may be represented by a velocity potential φ , satisfying the Laplace equation and [8] φ = ω k a e k z sin ⁡ ( k x − ω t ) . {\displaystyle \varphi ={\frac {\omega }{k}}a{\text{e}}^{kz}\sin(kx-\omega t).} In order to have non-trivial solutions for this eigenvalue problem, the wave length and wave period may not be chosen arbitrarily, but must satisfy the deep-water dispersion relation: [11] ω 2 = g k {\displaystyle \omega ^{2}=gk} with g the acceleration by gravity in (m/s 2 ). Within the framework of linear theory, the horizontal and vertical components, ξ x and ξ z respectively, of the Lagrangian position ξ are [9] ξ x = x + ∫ ∂ φ ∂ x d t = x − a e k z sin ⁡ ( k x − ω t ) , ξ z = z + ∫ ∂ φ ∂ z d t = z + a e k z cos ⁡ ( k x − ω t ) . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\xi _{x}&=x+\int {\frac {\partial \varphi }{\partial x}}\,{\text{d}}t=x-a{\text{e}}^{kz}\sin(kx-\omega t),\\\xi _{z}&=z+\int {\frac {\partial \varphi }{\partial z}}\,{\text{d}}t=z+a{\text{e}}^{kz}\cos(kx-\omega t).\end{aligned}}} The horizontal component ū S of the Stokes drift velocity is estimated by using a Taylor expansion around x of the Eulerian horizontal velocity component u x = ∂ ξ x / ∂ t at the position ξ : [5] u ¯ S = u x ( ξ , t ) ¯ − u x ( x , t ) ¯ = [ u x ( x , t ) + ( ξ x − x ) ∂ u x ( x , t ) ∂ x + ( ξ z − z ) ∂ u x ( x , t ) ∂ z + ⋯ ] ¯ − u x ( x , t ) ¯ ≈ ( ξ x − x ) ∂ 2 ξ x ∂ x ∂ t ¯ + ( ξ z − z ) ∂ 2 ξ x ∂ z ∂ t ¯ = [ − a e k z sin ⁡ ( k x − ω t ) ] [ − ω k a e k z sin ⁡ ( k x − ω t ) ] ¯ + [ a e k z cos ⁡ ( k x − ω t ) ] [ ω k a e k z cos ⁡ ( k x − ω t ) ] ¯ = ω k a 2 e 2 k z [ sin 2 ⁡ ( k x − ω t ) + cos 2 ⁡ ( k x − ω t ) ] ¯ = ω k a 2 e 2 k z . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\bar {u}}_{\text{S}}&={\overline {u_{x}({\boldsymbol {\xi }},t)}}-{\overline {u_{x}(\mathbf {x} ,t)}}\\&={\overline {\left[u_{x}(\mathbf {x} ,t)+(\xi _{x}-x){\frac {\partial u_{x}(\mathbf {x} ,t)}{\partial x}}+(\xi _{z}-z){\frac {\partial u_{x}(\mathbf {x} ,t)}{\partial z}}+\cdots \right]}}-{\overline {u_{x}(\mathbf {x} ,t)}}\\&\approx {\overline {(\xi _{x}-x){\frac {\partial ^{2}\xi _{x}}{\partial x\,\partial t}}}}+{\overline {(\xi _{z}-z){\frac {\partial ^{2}\xi _{x}}{\partial z\,\partial t}}}}\\&={\overline {\left[-a{\text{e}}^{kz}\sin(kx-\omega t)\right]\left[-\omega ka{\text{e}}^{kz}\sin(kx-\omega t)\right]}}\\&+{\overline {\left[a{\text{e}}^{kz}\cos(kx-\omega t)\right]\left[\omega ka{\text{e}}^{kz}\cos(kx-\omega t)\right]}}\\&={\overline {\omega ka^{2}{\text{e}}^{2kz}\left[\sin ^{2}(kx-\omega t)+\cos ^{2}(kx-\omega t)\right]}}\\&=\omega ka^{2}{\text{e}}^{2kz}.\end{aligned}}} See also [ edit ] Coriolis–Stokes force Darwin drift Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinates Material derivative References [ edit ] Historical [ edit ] A.D.D.

This is considered as one of the simplest unsteady problems that have an exact solution for the Navier-Stokes equations . The impulse movement of semi-infinite plate was studied by Keith Stewartson . [1] Flow description [ edit ] Consider an infinitely long plate which is suddenly made to move with constant velocity U {\displaystyle U} in the x {\displaystyle x} direction, which is located at y = 0 {\displaystyle y=0} in an infinite domain of fluid, which is at rest initially everywhere. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations reduce to [2] [3] ∂ u ∂ t = ν ∂ 2 u ∂ y 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial u}{\partial t}}=\nu {\frac {\partial ^{2}u}{\partial y^{2}}}} where ν {\displaystyle \nu } is the kinematic viscosity . The initial and the no-slip condition on the wall are u ( y , 0 ) = 0 , u ( 0 , t > 0 ) = U , u ( ∞ , t > 0 ) = 0 , {\displaystyle u(y,0)=0,\quad u(0,t>0)=U,\quad u(\infty ,t>0)=0,} the last condition is due to the fact that the motion at y = 0 {\displaystyle y=0} is not felt at infinity. The flow is only due to the motion of the plate, there is no imposed pressure gradient. Self-Similar solution [ edit ] The problem on the whole is similar to the one dimensional heat conduction problem. Hence a self-similar variable can be introduced [4] η = y ν t , f ( η ) = u U {\displaystyle \eta ={\frac {y}{\sqrt {\nu t}}},\quad f(\eta )={\frac {u}{U}}} Substituting this the partial differential equation, reduces it to ordinary differential equation f ″ + 1 2 η f ′ = 0 {\displaystyle f''+{\frac {1}{2}}\eta f'=0} with boundary conditions f ( 0 ) = 1 , f ( ∞ ) = 0 {\displaystyle f(0)=1,\quad f(\infty )=0} The solution to the above problem can be written in terms of complementary error function u = U e r f c ( y 4 ν t ) {\displaystyle u=U\mathrm {erfc} \left({\frac {y}{\sqrt {4\nu t}}}\right)} The force per unit area exerted on the plate is F = μ ( ∂ u ∂ y ) y = 0 = − ρ ν U 2 π t {\displaystyle F=\mu \left({\frac {\partial u}{\partial y}}\right)_{y=0}=-\rho {\sqrt {\frac {\nu U^{2}}{\pi t}}}} Arbitrary wall motion [ edit ] Instead of using a step boundary condition for the wall movement, the velocity of the wall can be prescribed as an arbitrary function of time, i.e., U = f ( t ) {\displaystyle U=f(t)} . Then the solution is given by [5] u ( y , t ) = ∫ 0 t f ( τ ) 2 π ν y ( t − τ ) 3 / 2 e − y 2 4 ν ( t − τ ) d τ . {\displaystyle u(y,t)=\int _{0}^{t}{\frac {f(\tau )}{2{\sqrt {\pi \nu }}}}{\frac {y}{(t-\tau )^{3/2}}}e^{-{\frac {y^{2}}{4\nu (t-\tau )}}}d\tau .} Rayleigh's problem in cylindrical geometry [ edit ] Rotating cylinder [ edit ] Consider an infinitely long cylinder of radius a {\displaystyle a} starts rotating suddenly at time t = 0 {\displaystyle t=0} with an angular velocity Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } . Then the velocity in the θ {\displaystyle \theta } direction is given by v θ = a Ω 2 π i ∫ − i ∞ i ∞ K 1 ( r s / ν ) K 1 ( a s / ν ) e s t d s s {\displaystyle v_{\theta }={\frac {a\Omega }{2\pi i}}\int _{-i\infty }^{i\infty }{\frac {K_{1}(r{\sqrt {s/\nu }})}{K_{1}(a{\sqrt {s/\nu }})}}e^{st}{\frac {ds}{s}}} where K 1 {\displaystyle K_{1}} is the modified Bessel function of the second kind. As t → ∞ {\displaystyle t\rightarrow \infty } , the solution approaches that of a rigid vortex. The force per unit area exerted on the cylinder is F = μ ( ∂ v θ ∂ r − v θ r ) r = a = ρ a 2 Ω t e − a 2 2 ν t I 0 ( a 2 2 ν t ) − 2 μ Ω {\displaystyle F=\mu \left({\frac {\partial v_{\theta }}{\partial r}}-{\frac {v_{\theta }}{r}}\right)_{r=a}={\frac {\rho a^{2}\Omega }{t}}e^{-{\frac {a^{2}}{2\nu t}}}I_{0}\left({\frac {a^{2}}{2\nu t}}\right)-2\mu \Omega } where I 0 {\displaystyle I_{0}} is the modified Bessel function of the first kind. Sliding cylinder [ edit ] Exact solution is also available when the cylinder starts to slide in the axial direction with constant velocity U {\displaystyle U} . If we consider the cylinder axis to be in x {\displaystyle x} direction, then the solution is given by u = U 2 π i ∫ − i ∞ i ∞ K 0 ( r s / ν ) K 0 ( a s / ν ) e s t d s s . {\displaystyle u={\frac {U}{2\pi i}}\int _{-i\infty }^{i\infty }{\frac {K_{0}(r{\sqrt {s/\nu }})}{K_{0}(a{\sqrt {s/\nu }})}}e^{st}{\frac {ds}{s}}.} See also [ edit ] Stokes problem References [ edit ] ^ Stewartson, K.

It states that the amplitude of a plane wave decreases exponentially with distance traveled, at a rate α given by α = 2 η ω 2 3 ρ V 3 {\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {2\eta \omega ^{2}}{3\rho V^{3}}}} where η is the dynamic viscosity coefficient of the fluid, ω is the sound's angular frequency , ρ is the fluid density , and V is the speed of sound in the medium. [1] The law and its derivation were published in 1845 by the Anglo-Irish physicist G. G. Stokes , who also developed Stokes's law for the friction force in fluid motion . A generalisation of Stokes attenuation taking into account the effect of thermal conductivity was proposed by the German physicist Gustav Kirchhoff in 1868. [2] [3] Sound attenuation in fluids is also accompanied by acoustic dispersion , meaning that the different frequencies are propagating at different sound speeds. [1] Interpretation [ edit ] Stokes's law of sound attenuation applies to sound propagation in an isotropic and homogeneous Newtonian medium. Consider a plane sinusoidal pressure wave that has amplitude A 0 at some point. After traveling a distance d from that point, its amplitude A ( d ) will be A ( d ) = A 0 e − α d {\displaystyle A(d)=A_{0}e^{-\alpha d}} The parameter α is a kind of attenuation constant , dimensionally the reciprocal of length. In the International System of Units (SI), it is expressed in neper per meter or simply reciprocal of meter (m –1 ). That is, if α = 1 m –1 , the wave's amplitude decreases by a factor of 1/ e for each meter traveled. Importance of volume viscosity [ edit ] The law is amended to include a contribution by the volume viscosity ζ : α = ( 2 η + 3 2 ζ ) ω 2 3 ρ V 3 = ( 4 3 η + ζ ) ω 2 2 ρ V 3 {\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {\left(2\eta +{\frac {3}{2}}\zeta \right)\omega ^{2}}{3\rho V^{3}}}={\frac {\left({\frac {4}{3}}\eta +\zeta \right)\omega ^{2}}{2\rho V^{3}}}} The volume viscosity coefficient is relevant when the fluid's compressibility cannot be ignored, such as in the case of ultrasound in water. [4] [5] [6] [7] The volume viscosity of water at 15 C is 3.09 centipoise .

This is opposed to the 3-dimensional case, where Stokes' method provides a solution to the problem of flow around a sphere. [1] [2] Stokes' paradox was resolved by Carl Wilhelm Oseen in 1910, by introducing the Oseen equations which improve upon the Stokes equations – by adding convective acceleration . Derivation [ edit ] The velocity vector u {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} } of the fluid may be written in terms of the stream function ψ {\displaystyle \psi } as u = ( ∂ ψ ∂ y , − ∂ ψ ∂ x ) . {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} =\left({\frac {\partial \psi }{\partial y}},-{\frac {\partial \psi }{\partial x}}\right).} The stream function in a Stokes flow problem, ψ {\displaystyle \psi } satisfies the biharmonic equation . [3] By regarding the ( x , y ) {\displaystyle (x,y)} -plane as the complex plane , the problem may be dealt with using methods of complex analysis . In this approach, ψ {\displaystyle \psi } is either the real or imaginary part of z ¯ f ( z ) + g ( z ) {\displaystyle {\bar {z}}f(z)+g(z)} . [4] Here z = x + i y {\displaystyle z=x+iy} , where i {\displaystyle i} is the imaginary unit, z ¯ = x − i y {\displaystyle {\bar {z}}=x-iy} , and f ( z ) , g ( z ) {\displaystyle f(z),g(z)} are holomorphic functions outside of the disk. We will take the real part without loss of generality . Now the function u {\displaystyle u} , defined by u = u x + i u y {\displaystyle u=u_{x}+iu_{y}} is introduced. u {\displaystyle u} can be written as u = − 2 i ∂ ψ ∂ z ¯ {\displaystyle u=-2i{\frac {\partial \psi }{\partial {\bar {z}}}}} , or 1 2 i u = ∂ ψ ∂ z ¯ {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}iu={\frac {\partial \psi }{\partial {\bar {z}}}}} (using the Wirtinger derivatives ). This is calculated to be equal to 1 2 i u = f ( z ) + z f ′ ¯ ( z ) + g ′ ¯ ( z ) . {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}iu=f(z)+z{\bar {f\prime }}(z)+{\bar {g\prime }}(z).} Without loss of generality, the disk may be assumed to be the unit disk , consisting of all complex numbers z of absolute value smaller or equal to 1. The boundary conditions are: lim z → ∞ u = 1 , {\displaystyle \lim _{z\to \infty }u=1,} u = 0 , {\displaystyle u=0,} whenever | z | = 1 {\displaystyle |z|=1} , [1] [5] and by representing the functions f , g {\displaystyle f,g} as Laurent series : [6] f ( z ) = ∑ n = − ∞ ∞ f n z n , g ( z ) = ∑ n = − ∞ ∞ g n z n , {\displaystyle f(z)=\sum _{n=-\infty }^{\infty }f_{n}z^{n},\quad g(z)=\sum _{n=-\infty }^{\infty }g_{n}z^{n},} the first condition implies f n = 0 , g n = 0 {\displaystyle f_{n}=0,g_{n}=0} for all n ≥ 2 {\displaystyle n\geq 2} . Using the polar form of z {\displaystyle z} results in z n = r n e i n θ , z ¯ n = r n e − i n θ {\displaystyle z^{n}=r^{n}e^{in\theta },{\bar {z}}^{n}=r^{n}e^{-in\theta }} . After deriving the series form of u , substituting this into it along with r = 1 {\displaystyle r=1} , and changing some indices, the second boundary condition translates to ∑ n = − ∞ ∞ e i n θ ( f n + ( 2 − n ) f ¯ 2 − n + ( 1 − n ) g ¯ 1 − n ) = 0. {\displaystyle \sum _{n=-\infty }^{\infty }e^{in\theta }\left(f_{n}+(2-n){\bar {f}}_{2-n}+(1-n){\bar {g}}_{1-n}\right)=0.} Since the complex trigonometric functions e i n θ {\displaystyle e^{in\theta }} compose a linearly independent set, it follows that all coefficients in the series are zero. Examining these conditions for every n {\displaystyle n} after taking into account the condition at infinity shows that f {\displaystyle f} and g {\displaystyle g} are necessarily of the form f ( z ) = a z + b , g ( z ) = − b z + c , {\displaystyle f(z)=az+b,\quad g(z)=-bz+c,} where a {\displaystyle a} is an imaginary number (opposite to its own complex conjugate ), and b {\displaystyle b} and c {\displaystyle c} are complex numbers. Substituting this into u {\displaystyle u} gives the result that u = 0 {\displaystyle u=0} globally, compelling both u x {\displaystyle u_{x}} and u y {\displaystyle u_{y}} to be zero. Therefore, there can be no motion – the only solution is that the cylinder is at rest relative to all points of the fluid. Resolution [ edit ] The paradox is caused by the limited validity of Stokes' approximation, as explained in Oseen's criticism: the validity of Stokes' equations relies on Reynolds number being small, and this condition cannot hold for arbitrarily large distances r {\displaystyle r} . [7] [2] A correct solution for a cylinder was derived using Oseen's equations , and the same equations lead to an improved approximation of the drag force on a sphere . [8] [9] Unsteady-state flow around a circular cylinder [ edit ] On the contrary to Stokes' paradox , there exists the unsteady-state solution of the same problem which models a fluid flow moving around a circular cylinder with Reynolds number being small. This solution can be given by explicit formula in terms of vorticity of the flow's vector field. Formula of the Stokes Flow around a circular cylinder [ edit ] The vorticity of Stokes' flow is given by the following relation: [10] w k ( t , r ) = W | k | , | k | − 1 − 1 [ e − λ 2 t W | k | , | k | − 1 [ w k ( 0 , ⋅ ) ] ( λ ) ] ( t , r ) . {\displaystyle w_{k}(t,r)=W_{|k|,|k|-1}^{-1}\left[e^{-\lambda ^{2}t}W_{|k|,|k|-1}[w_{k}(0,\cdot )](\lambda )\right](t,r).} Here w k ( t , r ) {\displaystyle w_{k}(t,r)} - are the Fourier coefficients of the vorticity's expansion by polar angle which are defined on ( r 0 , ∞ ) {\displaystyle (r_{0},\infty )} , r 0 {\displaystyle r_{0}} - radius of the cylinder, W | k | , | k | − 1 {\displaystyle W_{|k|,|k|-1}} , W | k | , | k | − 1 − 1 {\displaystyle W_{|k|,|k|-1}^{-1}} are the direct and inverse special Weber's transforms, [11] and initial function for vorticity w k ( 0 , r ) {\displaystyle w_{k}(0,r)} satisfies no-slip boundary condition. Special Weber's transform has a non-trivial kernel, but from the no-slip condition follows orthogonality of the vorticity flow to the kernel. [10] Derivation [ edit ] Special Weber's transform [ edit ] Special Weber's transform [11] is an important tool in solving problems of the hydrodynamics . It is defined for k ∈ R {\displaystyle k\in \mathbb {R} } as W k , k − 1 [ f ] ( λ ) = ∫ r 0 ∞ J k ( λ s ) Y k − 1 ( λ r 0 ) − Y k ( λ s ) J k − 1 ( λ r 0 ) J k − 1 2 ( λ r 0 ) + Y k − 1 2 ( λ r 0 ) f ( s ) s d s , {\displaystyle W_{k,k-1}[f](\lambda )=\int _{r_{0}}^{\infty }{\frac {J_{k}(\lambda s)Y_{k-1}(\lambda r_{0})-Y_{k}(\lambda s)J_{k-1}(\lambda r_{0})}{\sqrt {J_{k-1}^{2}(\lambda r_{0})+Y_{k-1}^{2}(\lambda r_{0})}}}f(s)sds,} where J k {\displaystyle J_{k}} , Y k {\displaystyle Y_{k}} are the Bessel functions of the first and second kind [12] respectively. For k > 1 {\displaystyle k>1} it has a non-trivial kernel [13] [10] which consists of the functions C / r k ∈ ker ⁡ ( W k , k − 1 ) {\displaystyle C/r^{k}\in \ker(W_{k,k-1})} . The inverse transform is given by the formula W k , k − 1 − 1 [ f ^ ] ( r ) = ∫ 0 ∞ J k ( λ r ) Y k − 1 ( λ r 0 ) − Y k ( λ s ) J k − 1 ( λ r 0 ) J k − 1 2 ( λ r 0 ) + Y k − 1 2 ( λ r 0 ) f ^ ( λ ) λ d λ . {\displaystyle W_{k,k-1}^{-1}[{\hat {f}}](r)=\int _{0}^{\infty }{\frac {J_{k}(\lambda r)Y_{k-1}(\lambda r_{0})-Y_{k}(\lambda s)J_{k-1}(\lambda r_{0})}{\sqrt {J_{k-1}^{2}(\lambda r_{0})+Y_{k-1}^{2}(\lambda r_{0})}}}{\hat {f}}(\lambda )\lambda d\lambda .} Due to non-triviality of the kernel, the inversion identity f ( r ) = W k , k − 1 − 1 [ W k , k − 1 [ f ] ] ( r ) {\displaystyle f(r)=W_{k,k-1}^{-1}\left[W_{k,k-1}[f]\right](r)} is valid if k ≤ 1 {\displaystyle k\leq 1} . Also it is valid in the case of k > 1 {\displaystyle k>1} but only for functions, which are orthogonal to the kernel of W k , k − 1 {\displaystyle W_{k,k-1}} in L 2 ( r 0 , ∞ ) {\displaystyle L_{2}(r_{0},\infty )} with infinitesimal element r d r {\displaystyle rdr} : ∫ r 0 ∞ 1 r k f ( r ) r d r = 0 , k > 1. {\displaystyle \int _{r_{0}}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{r^{k}}}f(r)rdr=0,~k>1.} No-slip condition and Biot–Savart law [ edit ] In exterior of the disc of radius r 0 {\displaystyle r_{0}} B r 0 = { x ∈ R 2 , | x | > r 0 } {\displaystyle B_{r_{0}}=\{\mathbf {x} \in \mathbb {R} ^{2},~\vert \mathbf {x} \vert >r_{0}\}} the Biot-Savart law v ( x ) = 1 2 π ∫ B r 0 ( x − y ) ⊥ | x − y | 2 w ( y ) d y + v ∞ , {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} (\mathbf {x} )={\frac {1}{2\pi }}\int _{B_{r_{0}}}{\frac {(\mathbf {x} -\mathbf {y} )^{\perp }}{\vert \mathbf {x} -\mathbf {y} \vert ^{2}}}w(\mathbf {y} )\operatorname {d\mathbf {y} } +\mathbf {v} _{\infty },} restores the velocity field v ( x ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} (\mathbf {x} )} which is induced by the vorticity w ( x ) {\displaystyle w(\mathbf {x} )} with zero-circularity and given constant velocity v ∞ {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{\infty }} at infinity. No-slip condition for x ∈ S r 0 = { x ∈ R 2 , | x | = r 0 } {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} \in S_{r_{0}}=\{\mathbf {x} \in \mathbb {R} ^{2},~\vert \mathbf {x} \vert =r_{0}\}} 1 2 π ∫ B r 0 ( x − y ) ⊥ | x − y | 2 w ( y ) d y + v ∞ = 0 {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2\pi }}\int _{B_{r_{0}}}{\frac {(\mathbf {x} -\mathbf {y} )^{\perp }}{\vert \mathbf {x} -\mathbf {y} \vert ^{2}}}w(\mathbf {y} )\operatorname {d\mathbf {y} } +\mathbf {v} _{\infty }=0} leads to the relations for k ∈ Z {\displaystyle k\in \mathbf {Z} } : ∫ r 0 ∞ r − | k | + 1 w k ( r ) d r = d k , {\displaystyle \int _{r_{0}}^{\infty }r^{-\vert k\vert +1}w_{k}(r)dr=d_{k},} where d k = δ | k | , 1 ( v ∞ , y + i k v ∞ , x ) , {\displaystyle d_{k}=\delta _{\vert k\vert ,1}(v_{\infty ,y}+ikv_{\infty ,x}),} δ | k | , 1 {\displaystyle \delta _{\vert k\vert ,1}} is the Kronecker delta , v ∞ , x {\displaystyle v_{\infty ,x}} , v ∞ , y {\displaystyle v_{\infty ,y}} are the cartesian coordinates of v ∞ {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{\infty }} . In particular, from the no-slip condition follows orthogonality the vorticity to the kernel of the Weber's transform W k , k − 1 {\displaystyle W_{k,k-1}} : ∫ r 0 ∞ r − | k | + 1 w k ( r ) d r = 0 f o r | k | > 1. {\displaystyle \int _{r_{0}}^{\infty }r^{-\vert k\vert +1}w_{k}(r)dr=0~for~|k|>1.} Vorticity flow and its boundary condition [ edit ] Vorticity w ( t , x ) {\displaystyle w(t,\mathbf {x} )} for Stokes flow satisfies to the vorticity equation ∂ w ( t , x ) ∂ t − Δ w = 0 , {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial w(t,\mathbf {x} )}{\partial t}}-\Delta w=0,} or in terms of the Fourier coefficients in the expansion by polar angle ∂ w k ( t , r ) ∂ t − Δ w k = 0 , {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial w_{k}(t,r)}{\partial t}}-\Delta w_{k}=0,} where Δ k w k ( t , r ) = 1 r ∂ ∂ r ( r ∂ ∂ r w k ( t , r ) ) − k 2 r 2 w k ( t , r ) . {\displaystyle \Delta _{k}w_{k}(t,r)={\frac {1}{r}}{\frac {\partial }{\partial r}}\left(r{\frac {\partial }{\partial r}}w_{k}(t,r)\right)-{\frac {k^{2}}{r^{2}}}w_{k}(t,r).} From no-slip condition follows d d t ∫ r 0 ∞ r − | k | + 1 w k ( t , r ) d r = 0. {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dt}}\int _{r_{0}}^{\infty }r^{-\vert k\vert +1}w_{k}(t,r)dr=0.} Finally, integrating by parts, we obtain the Robin boundary condition for the vorticity: ∫ r 0 ∞ s − | k | + 1 Δ k w k ( t , r ) d r = − r 0 − | k | ( r 0 ∂ w k ( t , r ) ∂ r | r = r 0 + | k | w k ( t , r 0 ) ) = 0. {\displaystyle \int _{r_{0}}^{\infty }s^{-|k|+1}\Delta _{k}w_{k}(t,r)dr=-r_{0}^{-|k|}\left(r_{0}{\frac {\partial w_{k}(t,r)}{\partial r}}{\Big |}_{r=r_{0}}+|k|w_{k}(t,r_{0})\right)=0.} Then the solution of the boundary-value problem can be expressed via Weber's integral above. Remark [ edit ] Formula for vorticity can give another explanation of the Stokes' Paradox. The functions C r k ∈ k e r ( Δ k ) , k > 1 {\displaystyle {\frac {C}{r^{k}}}\in ker(\Delta _{k}),~k>1} belong to the kernel of Δ k {\displaystyle \Delta _{k}} and generate the stationary solutions of the vorticity equation with Robin-type boundary condition. From the arguments above any Stokes' vorticity flow with no-slip boundary condition must be orthogonal to the obtained stationary solutions. That is only possible for w ≡ 0 {\displaystyle w\equiv 0} . See also [ edit ] Oseen's approximation Stokes' law References [ edit ] ^ a b Lamb, Horace (1945). Hydrodynamics (Sixth ed.).

Measurement procedure [ edit ] Traditional geodetic instruments such as theodolites rely on the gravity field for orienting their vertical axis along the local plumb line or local vertical direction with the aid of a spirit level . After that, vertical angles ( zenith angles or, alternatively, elevation angles) are obtained with respect to this local vertical, and horizontal angles in the plane of the local horizon, perpendicular to the vertical. Levelling instruments again are used to obtain geopotential differences between points on the Earth's surface. These can then be expressed as ""height"" differences by conversion to metric units. Units [ edit ] Gravity is commonly measured in units of m·s −2 ( metres per second squared). This also can be expressed (multiplying by the gravitational constant G in order to change units) as newtons per kilogram of attracted mass. Potential is expressed as gravity times distance, m 2 ·s −2 . Travelling one metre in the direction of a gravity vector of strength 1 m·s −2 will increase your potential by 1 m 2 ·s −2 . Again employing G as a multiplier, the units can be changed to joules per kilogram of attracted mass. A more convenient unit is the GPU, or geopotential unit: it equals 10 m 2 ·s −2 . This means that travelling one metre in the vertical direction, i.e., the direction of the 9.8 m·s −2 ambient gravity, will approximately change your potential by 1 GPU. Which again means that the difference in geopotential, in GPU, of a point with that of sea level can be used as a rough measure of height ""above sea level"" in metres. Gravity [ edit ] This section is an excerpt from Gravity of Earth . [ edit ] Earth's gravity measured by NASA GRACE mission, showing deviations from the theoretical gravity of an idealized, smooth Earth, the so-called Earth ellipsoid . Red shows the areas where gravity is stronger than the smooth, standard value, and blue reveals areas where gravity is weaker ( Animated version ). [1] The gravity of Earth , denoted by g , is the net acceleration that is imparted to objects due to the combined effect of gravitation (from mass distribution within Earth ) and the centrifugal force (from the Earth's rotation ). [2] [3] It is a vector quantity, whose direction coincides with a plumb bob and strength or magnitude is given by the norm g = ‖ g ‖ {\displaystyle g=\|{\mathit {\mathbf {g} }}\|} . In SI units , this acceleration is expressed in metres per second squared (in symbols, m / s 2 or m·s −2 ) or equivalently in newtons per kilogram (N/kg or N·kg −1 ). Near Earth's surface, the acceleration due to gravity, accurate to 2 significant figures , is 9.8 m/s 2 (32 ft/s 2 ). This means that, ignoring the effects of air resistance , the speed of an object falling freely will increase by about 9.8 metres per second (32 ft/s) every second. This quantity is sometimes referred to informally as little g (in contrast, the gravitational constant G is referred to as big G ). The precise strength of Earth's gravity varies with location. The agreed upon value for standard gravity is 9.80665 m/s 2 (32.1740 ft/s 2 ) by definition. [4] This quantity is denoted variously as g n , g e (though this sometimes means the normal gravity at the equator, 9.7803267715 m/s 2 (32.087686258 ft/s 2 )), [5] g 0 , or simply g (which is also used for the variable local value). The weight of an object on Earth's surface is the downwards force on that object, given by Newton's second law of motion , or F = m a ( force = mass × acceleration ). Gravitational acceleration contributes to the total gravity acceleration, but other factors, such as the rotation of Earth, also contribute, and, therefore, affect the weight of the object. Gravity does not normally include the gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun, which are accounted for in terms of tidal effects . Potential fields [ edit ] This section is an excerpt from Geopotential . [ edit ] Geopotential is the potential of the Earth 's gravity field . For convenience it is often defined as the negative of the potential energy per unit mass , so that the gravity vector is obtained as the gradient of the geopotential, without the negation. In addition to the actual potential (the geopotential), a hypothetical normal potential and their difference, the disturbing potential, can also be defined. Geoid [ edit ] Main article: Geoid Map of the undulation of the geoid in meters (based on the EGM96 ) Due to the irregularity of the Earth's true gravity field, the equilibrium figure of sea water, or the geoid , will also be of irregular form. In some places, like west of Ireland , the geoid—mathematical mean sea level—sticks out as much as 100 m above the regular, rotationally symmetric reference ellipsoid of GRS80; in other places, like close to Sri Lanka , it dives under the ellipsoid by nearly the same amount. The separation between the geoid and the reference ellipsoid is called the undulation of the geoid , symbol N {\displaystyle N} . The geoid, or mathematical mean sea surface, is defined not only on the seas, but also under land; it is the equilibrium water surface that would result, would sea water be allowed to move freely (e.g., through tunnels) under the land. Technically, an equipotential surface of the true geopotential, chosen to coincide (on average) with mean sea level. As mean sea level is physically realized by tide gauge bench marks on the coasts of different countries and continents, a number of slightly incompatible ""near-geoids"" will result, with differences of several decimetres to over one metre between them, due to the dynamic sea surface topography . These are referred to as vertical datums or height datums . For every point on Earth, the local direction of gravity or vertical direction , materialized with the plumb line , is perpendicular to the geoid (see astrogeodetic leveling ). Geoid determination [ edit ] Main article: Geoid determination The undulation of the geoid is closely related to the disturbing potential according to the famous Bruns ' formula : N = T / γ , {\displaystyle N=T/\gamma \,,} where γ {\displaystyle \gamma } is the force of gravity computed from the normal field potential U {\displaystyle U} . In 1849, the mathematician George Gabriel Stokes published the following formula, named after him: N = R 4 π γ 0 ∬ σ Δ g S ( ψ ) d σ . {\displaystyle N={\frac {R}{4\pi \gamma _{0}}}\iint _{\sigma }\Delta g\,S(\psi )\,d\sigma .} In Stokes' formula or Stokes' integral , Δ g {\displaystyle \Delta g} stands for gravity anomaly , differences between true and normal (reference) gravity, and S is the Stokes function , a kernel function derived by Stokes in closed analytical form. [6] Note that determining N {\displaystyle N} anywhere on Earth by this formula requires Δ g {\displaystyle \Delta g} to be known everywhere on Earth , including oceans, polar areas, and deserts. For terrestrial gravimetric measurements this is a near-impossibility, in spite of close international co-operation within the International Association of Geodesy (IAG), e.g., through the International Gravity Bureau (BGI, Bureau Gravimétrique International). Another approach is to combine multiple information sources: not just terrestrial gravimetry, but also satellite geodetic data on the figure of the Earth, from analysis of satellite orbital perturbations, and lately from satellite gravity missions such as GOCE and GRACE . In such combination solutions, the low-resolution part of the geoid solution is provided by the satellite data, while a 'tuned' version of the above Stokes equation is used to calculate the high-resolution part, from terrestrial gravimetric data from a neighbourhood of the evaluation point only. Gravity anomalies [ edit ] Main article: Gravity anomaly Above we already made use of gravity anomalies Δ g {\displaystyle \Delta g} . These are computed as the differences between true (observed) gravity g = ‖ g → ‖ {\displaystyle g=\|{\vec {g}}\|} , and calculated (normal) gravity γ = ‖ γ → ‖ = ‖ ∇ U ‖ {\displaystyle \gamma =\|{\vec {\gamma }}\|=\|\nabla U\|} . (This is an oversimplification; in practice the location in space at which γ is evaluated will differ slightly from that where g has been measured.) We thus get Δ g = g − γ . {\displaystyle \Delta g=g-\gamma .\,} These anomalies are called free-air anomalies , and are the ones to be used in the above Stokes equation. In geophysics , these anomalies are often further reduced by removing from them the attraction of the topography , which for a flat, horizontal plate ( Bouguer plate ) of thickness H is given by a B = 2 π G ρ H , {\displaystyle a_{B}=2\pi G\rho H,\,} The Bouguer reduction to be applied as follows: Δ g B = Δ g F A − a B , {\displaystyle \Delta g_{B}=\Delta g_{FA}-a_{B},\,} so-called Bouguer anomalies . Here, Δ g F A {\displaystyle \Delta g_{FA}} is our earlier Δ g {\displaystyle \Delta g} , the free-air anomaly. In case the terrain is not a flat plate (the usual case!) we use for H the local terrain height value but apply a further correction called the terrain correction .

Terminal velocity is achieved when the drag force is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the force propelling the object. Shown is a sphere in Stokes flow, at very low Reynolds number . Stokes flow (named after George Gabriel Stokes ), also named creeping flow or creeping motion , [1] is a type of fluid flow where advective inertial forces are small compared with viscous forces. [2] The Reynolds number is low, i.e. R e ≪ 1 {\displaystyle \mathrm {Re} \ll 1} . This is a typical situation in flows where the fluid velocities are very slow, the viscosities are very large, or the length-scales of the flow are very small. Creeping flow was first studied to understand lubrication . In nature, this type of flow occurs in the swimming of microorganisms and sperm . [3] In technology, it occurs in paint , MEMS devices, and in the flow of viscous polymers generally. The equations of motion for Stokes flow, called the Stokes equations, are a linearization of the Navier–Stokes equations , and thus can be solved by a number of well-known methods for linear differential equations. [4] The primary Green's function of Stokes flow is the Stokeslet , which is associated with a singular point force embedded in a Stokes flow. From its derivatives, other fundamental solutions can be obtained. [5] The Stokeslet was first derived by Oseen in 1927, although it was not named as such until 1953 by Hancock. [6] The closed-form fundamental solutions for the generalized unsteady Stokes and Oseen flows associated with arbitrary time-dependent translational and rotational motions have been derived for the Newtonian [7] and micropolar [8] fluids. Stokes equations [ edit ] The equation of motion for Stokes flow can be obtained by linearizing the steady state Navier–Stokes equations . The inertial forces are assumed to be negligible in comparison to the viscous forces, and eliminating the inertial terms of the momentum balance in the Navier–Stokes equations reduces it to the momentum balance in the Stokes equations: [1] ∇ ⋅ σ + f = 0 {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\cdot \sigma +\mathbf {f} ={\boldsymbol {0}}} where σ {\displaystyle \sigma } is the stress (sum of viscous and pressure stresses), [9] [10] and f {\displaystyle \mathbf {f} } an applied body force. The full Stokes equations also include an equation for the conservation of mass , commonly written in the form: ∂ ρ ∂ t + ∇ ⋅ ( ρ u ) = 0 {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \rho }{\partial t}}+\nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf {u} )=0} where ρ {\displaystyle \rho } is the fluid density and u {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} } the fluid velocity. To obtain the equations of motion for incompressible flow, it is assumed that the density, ρ {\displaystyle \rho } , is a constant. Furthermore, occasionally one might consider the unsteady Stokes equations, in which the term ρ ∂ u ∂ t {\displaystyle \rho {\frac {\partial \mathbf {u} }{\partial t}}} is added to the left hand side of the momentum balance equation. [1] Properties [ edit ] The Stokes equations represent a considerable simplification of the full Navier–Stokes equations , especially in the incompressible Newtonian case. [2] [4] [9] [10] They are the leading-order simplification of the full Navier–Stokes equations, valid in the distinguished limit R e → 0. {\displaystyle \mathrm {Re} \to 0.} Instantaneity A Stokes flow has no dependence on time other than through time-dependent boundary conditions . This means that, given the boundary conditions of a Stokes flow, the flow can be found without knowledge of the flow at any other time. Time-reversibility An immediate consequence of instantaneity, time-reversibility means that a time-reversed Stokes flow solves the same equations as the original Stokes flow. This property can sometimes be used (in conjunction with linearity and symmetry in the boundary conditions) to derive results about a flow without solving it fully. Time reversibility means that it is difficult to mix two fluids using creeping flow. Time-reversibility of Stokes Flows: Dye has been injected into a viscous fluid sandwiched between two concentric cylinders (top panel). The core cylinder is then rotated to shear the dye into a spiral as viewed from above. The dye appears to be mixed with the fluid viewed from the side (middle panel). The rotation is then reversed bringing the cylinder to its original position. The dye ""unmixes"" (bottom panel). Reversal is not perfect because some diffusion of dye occurs. [11] [12] While these properties are true for incompressible Newtonian Stokes flows, the non-linear and sometimes time-dependent nature of non-Newtonian fluids means that they do not hold in the more general case. Stokes paradox [ edit ] An interesting property of Stokes flow is known as the Stokes' paradox : that there can be no Stokes flow of a fluid around a disk in two dimensions; or, equivalently, the fact there is no non-trivial solution for the Stokes equations around an infinitely long cylinder. [13] Demonstration of time-reversibility [ edit ] A Taylor–Couette system can create laminar flows in which concentric cylinders of fluid move past each other in an apparent spiral. [14] A fluid such as corn syrup with high viscosity fills the gap between two cylinders, with colored regions of the fluid visible through the transparent outer cylinder. The cylinders are rotated relative to one another at a low speed, which together with the high viscosity of the fluid and thinness of the gap gives a low Reynolds number , so that the apparent mixing of colors is actually laminar and can then be reversed to approximately the initial state. This creates a dramatic demonstration of seemingly mixing a fluid and then unmixing it by reversing the direction of the mixer. [15] [16] [17] Incompressible flow of Newtonian fluids [ edit ] In the common case of an incompressible Newtonian fluid , the Stokes equations take the (vectorized) form: μ ∇ 2 u − ∇ p + f = 0 ∇ ⋅ u = 0 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mu \nabla ^{2}\mathbf {u} -{\boldsymbol {\nabla }}p+\mathbf {f} &={\boldsymbol {0}}\\{\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\cdot \mathbf {u} &=0\end{aligned}}} where u {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} } is the velocity of the fluid, ∇ p {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\nabla }}p} is the gradient of the pressure , μ {\displaystyle \mu } is the dynamic viscosity, and f {\displaystyle \mathbf {f} } an applied body force. The resulting equations are linear in velocity and pressure, and therefore can take advantage of a variety of linear differential equation solvers. [4] Cartesian coordinates [ edit ] With the velocity vector expanded as u = ( u , v , w ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} =(u,v,w)} and similarly the body force vector f = ( f x , f y , f z ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {f} =(f_{x},f_{y},f_{z})} , we may write the vector equation explicitly, μ ( ∂ 2 u ∂ x 2 + ∂ 2 u ∂ y 2 + ∂ 2 u ∂ z 2 ) − ∂ p ∂ x + f x = 0 μ ( ∂ 2 v ∂ x 2 + ∂ 2 v ∂ y 2 + ∂ 2 v ∂ z 2 ) − ∂ p ∂ y + f y = 0 μ ( ∂ 2 w ∂ x 2 + ∂ 2 w ∂ y 2 + ∂ 2 w ∂ z 2 ) − ∂ p ∂ z + f z = 0 ∂ u ∂ x + ∂ v ∂ y + ∂ w ∂ z = 0 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mu \left({\frac {\partial ^{2}u}{\partial x^{2}}}+{\frac {\partial ^{2}u}{\partial y^{2}}}+{\frac {\partial ^{2}u}{\partial z^{2}}}\right)-{\frac {\partial p}{\partial x}}+f_{x}&=0\\\mu \left({\frac {\partial ^{2}v}{\partial x^{2}}}+{\frac {\partial ^{2}v}{\partial y^{2}}}+{\frac {\partial ^{2}v}{\partial z^{2}}}\right)-{\frac {\partial p}{\partial y}}+f_{y}&=0\\\mu \left({\frac {\partial ^{2}w}{\partial x^{2}}}+{\frac {\partial ^{2}w}{\partial y^{2}}}+{\frac {\partial ^{2}w}{\partial z^{2}}}\right)-{\frac {\partial p}{\partial z}}+f_{z}&=0\\{\partial u \over \partial x}+{\partial v \over \partial y}+{\partial w \over \partial z}&=0\end{aligned}}} We arrive at these equations by making the assumptions that P = μ ( ∇ u + ( ∇ u ) T ) − p I {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} =\mu \left({\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\mathbf {u} +({\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\mathbf {u} )^{\mathsf {T}}\right)-p\mathbb {I} } and the density ρ {\displaystyle \rho } is a constant. [9] Methods of solution [ edit ] By stream function [ edit ] The equation for an incompressible Newtonian Stokes flow can be solved by the stream function method in planar or in 3-D axisymmetric cases Type of function Geometry Equation Comments Stream function , ψ {\displaystyle \psi } 2-D planar ∇ 4 ψ = 0 {\displaystyle \nabla ^{4}\psi =0} or Δ 2 ψ = 0 {\displaystyle \Delta ^{2}\psi =0} ( biharmonic equation ) Δ {\displaystyle \Delta } is the Laplacian operator in two dimensions Stokes stream function , Ψ {\displaystyle \Psi } 3-D spherical E 2 Ψ = 0 , {\displaystyle E^{2}\Psi =0,} where E = ∂ 2 ∂ r 2 + sin ⁡ θ r 2 ∂ ∂ θ ( 1 sin ⁡ θ ∂ ∂ θ ) {\displaystyle E={\partial ^{2} \over \partial r^{2}}+{\sin {\theta } \over r^{2}}{\partial \over \partial \theta }\left({1 \over \sin {\theta }}{\partial \over \partial \theta }\right)} For derivation of the E {\displaystyle E} operator see Stokes stream function#Vorticity 3-D cylindrical L − 1 2 Ψ = 0 , {\displaystyle L_{-1}^{2}\Psi =0,} where L − 1 = ∂ 2 ∂ z 2 + ∂ 2 ∂ ρ 2 − 1 ρ ∂ ∂ ρ {\displaystyle L_{-1}={\frac {\partial ^{2}}{\partial z^{2}}}+{\frac {\partial ^{2}}{\partial \rho ^{2}}}-{\frac {1}{\rho }}{\frac {\partial }{\partial \rho }}} For L − 1 {\displaystyle L_{-1}} see [18] By Green's function: the Stokeslet [ edit ] The linearity of the Stokes equations in the case of an incompressible Newtonian fluid means that a Green's function , J ( r ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {J} (\mathbf {r} )} , exists. The Green's function is found by solving the Stokes equations with the forcing term replaced by a point force acting at the origin, and boundary conditions vanishing at infinity: μ ∇ 2 u − ∇ p = − F ⋅ δ ( r ) ∇ ⋅ u = 0 | u | , p → 0 as r → ∞ {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mu \nabla ^{2}\mathbf {u} -{\boldsymbol {\nabla }}p&=-\mathbf {F} \cdot \mathbf {\delta } (\mathbf {r} )\\{\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\cdot \mathbf {u} &=0\\|\mathbf {u} |,p&\to 0\quad {\mbox{as}}\quad r\to \infty \end{aligned}}} where δ ( r ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {\delta } (\mathbf {r} )} is the Dirac delta function , and F ⋅ δ ( r ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} \cdot \delta (\mathbf {r} )} represents a point force acting at the origin. The solution for the pressure p and velocity u with | u | and p vanishing at infinity is given by [1] u ( r ) = F ⋅ J ( r ) , p ( r ) = F ⋅ r 4 π | r | 3 {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} (\mathbf {r} )=\mathbf {F} \cdot \mathbb {J} (\mathbf {r} ),\qquad p(\mathbf {r} )={\frac {\mathbf {F} \cdot \mathbf {r} }{4\pi |\mathbf {r} |^{3}}}} where J ( r ) = 1 8 π μ ( I | r | + r r | r | 3 ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {J} (\mathbf {r} )={1 \over 8\pi \mu }\left({\frac {\mathbb {I} }{|\mathbf {r} |}}+{\frac {\mathbf {r} \mathbf {r} }{|\mathbf {r} |^{3}}}\right)} is a second-rank tensor (or more accurately tensor field ) known as the Oseen tensor (after Carl Wilhelm Oseen ). Here, r r is a quantity such that F ⋅ ( r r ) = ( F ⋅ r ) r {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} \cdot (\mathbf {r} \mathbf {r} )=(\mathbf {F} \cdot \mathbf {r} )\mathbf {r} } . [ clarification needed ] The terms Stokeslet and point-force solution are used to describe F ⋅ J ( r ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} \cdot \mathbb {J} (\mathbf {r} )} . Analogous to the point charge in electrostatics , the Stokeslet is force-free everywhere except at the origin, where it contains a force of strength F {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} } . For a continuous-force distribution (density) f ( r ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {f} (\mathbf {r} )} the solution (again vanishing at infinity) can then be constructed by superposition: u ( r ) = ∫ f ( r ′ ) ⋅ J ( r − r ′ ) d r ′ , p ( r ) = ∫ f ( r ′ ) ⋅ ( r − r ′ ) 4 π | r − r ′ | 3 d r ′ {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} (\mathbf {r} )=\int \mathbf {f} \left(\mathbf {r'} \right)\cdot \mathbb {J} \left(\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {r'} \right)\mathrm {d} \mathbf {r'} ,\qquad p(\mathbf {r} )=\int {\frac {\mathbf {f} \left(\mathbf {r'} \right)\cdot \left(\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {r'} \right)}{4\pi \left|\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {r'} \right|^{3}}}\,\mathrm {d} \mathbf {r'} } This integral representation of the velocity can be viewed as a reduction in dimensionality: from the three-dimensional partial differential equation to a two-dimensional integral equation for unknown densities. [1] By Papkovich–Neuber solution [ edit ] The Papkovich–Neuber solution represents the velocity and pressure fields of an incompressible Newtonian Stokes flow in terms of two harmonic potentials. By boundary element method [ edit ] Certain problems, such as the evolution of the shape of a bubble in a Stokes flow, are conducive to numerical solution by the boundary element method . This technique can be applied to both 2- and 3-dimensional flows. Some geometries [ edit ] Hele-Shaw flow [ edit ] Hele-Shaw flow is an example of a geometry for which inertia forces are negligible. It is defined by two parallel plates arranged very close together with the space between the plates occupied partly by fluid and partly by obstacles in the form of cylinders with generators normal to the plates. [9] Slender-body theory [ edit ] Slender-body theory in Stokes flow is a simple approximate method of determining the irrotational flow field around bodies whose length is large compared with their width. The basis of the method is to choose a distribution of flow singularities along a line (since the body is slender) so that their irrotational flow in combination with a uniform stream approximately satisfies the zero normal velocity condition. [9] Spherical coordinates [ edit ] Lamb 's general solution arises from the fact that the pressure p {\displaystyle p} satisfies the Laplace equation , and can be expanded in a series of solid spherical harmonics in spherical coordinates. As a result, the solution to the Stokes equations can be written: u = ∑ n = − ∞ , n ≠ − 1 n = ∞ [ ( n + 3 ) r 2 ∇ p n 2 μ ( n + 1 ) ( 2 n + 3 ) − n x p n μ ( n + 1 ) ( 2 n + 3 ) ] + . . . ∑ n = − ∞ n = ∞ [ ∇ Φ n + ∇ × ( x χ n ) ] p = ∑ n = − ∞ n = ∞ p n {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbf {u} &=\sum _{n=-\infty ,n\neq -1}^{n=\infty }\left[{\frac {(n+3)r^{2}\nabla p_{n}}{2\mu (n+1)(2n+3)}}-{\frac {n\mathbf {x} p_{n}}{\mu (n+1)(2n+3)}}\right]+...\\\sum _{n=-\infty }^{n=\infty }[\nabla \Phi _{n}+\nabla \times (\mathbf {x} \chi _{n})]\\p&=\sum _{n=-\infty }^{n=\infty }p_{n}\end{aligned}}} where p n , Φ n , {\displaystyle p_{n},\Phi _{n},} and χ n {\displaystyle \chi _{n}} are solid spherical harmonics of order n {\displaystyle n} : p n = r n ∑ m = 0 m = n P n m ( cos ⁡ θ ) ( a m n cos ⁡ m ϕ + a ~ m n sin ⁡ m ϕ ) Φ n = r n ∑ m = 0 m = n P n m ( cos ⁡ θ ) ( b m n cos ⁡ m ϕ + b ~ m n sin ⁡ m ϕ ) χ n = r n ∑ m = 0 m = n P n m ( cos ⁡ θ ) ( c m n cos ⁡ m ϕ + c ~ m n sin ⁡ m ϕ ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p_{n}&=r^{n}\sum _{m=0}^{m=n}P_{n}^{m}(\cos \theta )(a_{mn}\cos m\phi +{\tilde {a}}_{mn}\sin m\phi )\\\Phi _{n}&=r^{n}\sum _{m=0}^{m=n}P_{n}^{m}(\cos \theta )(b_{mn}\cos m\phi +{\tilde {b}}_{mn}\sin m\phi )\\\chi _{n}&=r^{n}\sum _{m=0}^{m=n}P_{n}^{m}(\cos \theta )(c_{mn}\cos m\phi +{\tilde {c}}_{mn}\sin m\phi )\end{aligned}}} and the P n m {\displaystyle P_{n}^{m}} are the associated Legendre polynomials . The Lamb's solution can be used to describe the motion of fluid either inside or outside a sphere. For example, it can be used to describe the motion of fluid around a spherical particle with prescribed surface flow, a so-called squirmer , or to describe the flow inside a spherical drop of fluid. For interior flows, the terms with n < 0 {\displaystyle n<0} are dropped, while for exterior flows the terms with n > 0 {\displaystyle n>0} are dropped (often the convention n → − n − 1 {\displaystyle n\to -n-1} is assumed for exterior flows to avoid indexing by negative numbers). [1] Theorems [ edit ] Stokes solution and related Helmholtz theorem [ edit ] See also: Stokes' law The drag resistance to a moving sphere, also known as Stokes' solution is here summarised. Given a sphere of radius a {\displaystyle a} , travelling at velocity U {\displaystyle U} , in a Stokes fluid with dynamic viscosity μ {\displaystyle \mu } , the drag force F D {\displaystyle F_{D}} is given by: [9] F D = 6 π μ a U {\displaystyle F_{D}=6\pi \mu aU} The Stokes solution dissipates less energy than any other solenoidal vector field with the same boundary velocities: this is known as the Helmholtz minimum dissipation theorem . [1] Lorentz reciprocal theorem [ edit ] The Lorentz reciprocal theorem states a relationship between two Stokes flows in the same region. Consider fluid filled region V {\displaystyle V} bounded by surface S {\displaystyle S} . Let the velocity fields u {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} } and u ′ {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} '} solve the Stokes equations in the domain V {\displaystyle V} , each with corresponding stress fields σ {\displaystyle \mathbf {\sigma } } and σ ′ {\displaystyle \mathbf {\sigma } '} . Then the following equality holds: ∫ S u ⋅ ( σ ′ ⋅ n ) d S = ∫ S u ′ ⋅ ( σ ⋅ n ) d S {\displaystyle \int _{S}\mathbf {u} \cdot ({\boldsymbol {\sigma }}'\cdot \mathbf {n} )dS=\int _{S}\mathbf {u} '\cdot ({\boldsymbol {\sigma }}\cdot \mathbf {n} )dS} Where n {\displaystyle \mathbf {n} } is the unit normal on the surface S {\displaystyle S} . The Lorentz reciprocal theorem can be used to show that Stokes flow ""transmits"" unchanged the total force and torque from an inner closed surface to an outer enclosing surface. [1] The Lorentz reciprocal theorem can also be used to relate the swimming speed of a microorganism, such as cyanobacterium , to the surface velocity which is prescribed by deformations of the body shape via cilia or flagella . [19] The Lorentz reciprocal theorem has also been used in the context of elastohydrodynamic theory to derive the lift force exerted on a solid object moving tangent to the surface of an elastic interface at low Reynolds numbers . [20] [21] Faxén's laws [ edit ] Faxén's laws are direct relations that express the multipole moments in terms of the ambient flow and its derivatives. First developed by Hilding Faxén to calculate the force, F {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} } , and torque, T {\displaystyle \mathbf {T} } on a sphere, they take the following form: F = 6 π μ a ( 1 + a 2 6 ∇ 2 ) v ∞ ( x ) | x = 0 − 6 π μ a U T = 8 π μ a 3 ( Ω ∞ ( x ) − ω ) | x = 0 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbf {F} &=6\pi \mu a\left(1+{\frac {a^{2}}{6}}\nabla ^{2}\right)\mathbf {v} ^{\infty }(\mathbf {x} )|_{x=0}-6\pi \mu a\mathbf {U} \\\mathbf {T} &=8\pi \mu a^{3}(\mathbf {\Omega } ^{\infty }(\mathbf {x} )-\mathbf {\omega } )|_{x=0}\end{aligned}}} where μ {\displaystyle \mu } is the dynamic viscosity, a {\displaystyle a} is the particle radius, v ∞ {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} ^{\infty }} is the ambient flow, U {\displaystyle \mathbf {U} } is the speed of the particle, Ω ∞ {\displaystyle \mathbf {\Omega } ^{\infty }} is the angular velocity of the background flow, and ω {\displaystyle \mathbf {\omega } } is the angular velocity of the particle. Faxén's laws can be generalized to describe the moments of other shapes, such as ellipsoids, spheroids, and spherical drops.

Find sources: ""Campbell–Stokes recorder"" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( June 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Campbell–Stokes recorder used in a tropical region . A Campbell–Stokes recorder adapted for use in polar regions (The right sphere is facing south) The Campbell–Stokes recorder (sometimes called a Stokes sphere ) is a type of sunshine recorder . It was invented by John Francis Campbell in 1853 and modified in 1879 by Sir George Gabriel Stokes . The original design by Campbell consisted of large ball lens set into a wooden bowl with the Sun burning a trace on the bowl. Stokes's refinement was to make the housing out of metal and to have a card holder set behind the sphere. The unit is designed to record the hours of bright sunshine which will burn a hole through the card. A Campbell–Stokes sunshine recorder This basic unit is still in use today with very little change. It is widely used outside the United States (the Marvin sunshine recorder is generally the instrument used by the U.S. National Weather Service ). Technology [ edit ] Sunshine card for the Campbell-Stokes recorder The crystal ball is typically 10 cm (4 inches) in diameter, and is designed to focus the rays from the Sun onto a card mounted at the back and is set on a stand. The card is held in place by grooves of which there are three overlapping sets, to allow for the altitude of the Sun during different seasons of the year. The recording of each day goes onto one card. In the northern hemisphere the winter cards are used from 15 October to 29 February, the equinox cards from 1 March to 11 April and 3 September to 14 October. The summer cards are therefore used from 12 April to 2 September. Each card is marked as to the hour, with local noon being in the centre, and is read in tenths. In the northern hemisphere , the unit is set in a stand facing south to enable the maximum amount of Sun to be recorded. It is important to place the unit in an area where the Sun will not be blocked by buildings, trees or flagpoles. A modification to the standard unit for polar regions is the addition of a second, north facing, sphere and card, to record the sunlight during the summer when it remains in the sky for 24 hours. Advantages [ edit ] The major advantage of this type of recorder is its simplicity and ease of use. There are no moving parts and it thus requires very little maintenance. The unit can be used anywhere in the world with little or no modification to the design. Electrically operated pyranometers can do the same work, but the Campbell–Stokes recorder uses solar power. Disadvantages [ edit ] When the Sun is low in the sky it may not have enough strength to properly burn the card and thus can only measure the amount of bright sunshine as opposed to visible sunshine. This often occurs at dawn and dusk. Rain may cause the card to be torn when removing it and thus making it difficult to read. In areas of high frost and during periods of freezing rain the sphere may be difficult to clean and may not be removed before the Sun is shining again. It is also susceptible to external, non-weather factors such as dust, dirt or dried bird droppings accumulating on the glass sphere which requires frequent inspection and cleaning. The single biggest problem is in the reading of the cards. On days when the Sun is alternately covered and exposed by clouds, the amount of burn on the card may be the same for 30 seconds as for 5 minutes. Thus, the reading of the card may differ from one observer to another. Comparisons with automatic instruments at German stations revealed that during summer the differences of the two measurement systems can reach up to 4 h per day. The mean difference was −0.23 h, i.e. the measurements of the Campbell–Stokes recorder are larger than the automatic. [1] Instruments cost $US500–2,000.

They also relate the transmission and reflection coefficients for the interaction. Their derivation [1] [2] [3] relies on a time-reversal argument, so they only work when there is no absorption in the system. A reflection of the incoming field ( E ) is transmitted at the dielectric boundary to give rE and tE (where r and t are the amplitude reflection and transmission coefficients, respectively). Since there is no absorption this system is reversible, as shown in the second picture (where the direction of the beams has been reversed). If this reversed process were actually taking place, there will be parts of the incoming fields ( rE and tE ) that are themselves transmitted and reflected at the boundary. In the third picture, this is shown by the coefficients r and t (for reflection and transmission of the reversed fields). Everything must interfere so that the second and third pictures agree; beam x has amplitude E and beam y has amplitude 0 , providing Stokes relations. The most interesting result here is that r=-r’ . Thus, whatever phase is associated with reflection on one side of the interface, it is 180 degrees different on the other side of the interface. For example, if r has a phase of 0, r’ has a phase of 180 degrees. Explicit values for the transmission and reflection coefficients are provided by the Fresnel equations References [ edit ] ^ a b Hecht, Eugene, Optics, Fourth Edition, ISBN 978-0805385663 ^ Lipson, Ariel, Lipson, Stephen G. and Lipson Henry, Optical Physics, 4th Ed.

This force acts on water independently of the wind stress . [1] This force is named after Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis and George Gabriel Stokes , two nineteenth-century scientists. Important initial studies into the effects of the Earth's rotation on the wave motion – and the resulting forcing effects on the mean ocean circulation – were done by Ursell & Deacon (1950) , Hasselmann (1970) and Pollard (1970) . [1] The Coriolis–Stokes forcing on the mean circulation in an Eulerian reference frame was first given by Hasselmann (1970) : [1] ρ f × u S , {\displaystyle \rho {\boldsymbol {f}}\times {\boldsymbol {u}}_{S},} to be added to the common Coriolis forcing ρ f × u . {\displaystyle \rho {\boldsymbol {f}}\times {\boldsymbol {u}}.} Here u {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {u}}} is the mean flow velocity in an Eulerian reference frame and u S {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {u}}_{S}} is the Stokes drift velocity – provided both are horizontal velocities (perpendicular to z ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {\boldsymbol {z}}}} ). Further ρ {\displaystyle \rho } is the fluid density , × {\displaystyle \times } is the cross product operator, f = f z ^ {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {f}}=f{\hat {\boldsymbol {z}}}} where f = 2 Ω sin ⁡ ϕ {\displaystyle f=2\Omega \sin \phi } is the Coriolis parameter (with Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } the Earth's rotation angular speed and sin ⁡ ϕ {\displaystyle \sin \phi } the sine of the latitude ) and z ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {\boldsymbol {z}}}} is the unit vector in the vertical upward direction (opposing the Earth's gravity ). Since the Stokes drift velocity u S {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {u}}_{S}} is in the wave propagation direction, and f {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {f}}} is in the vertical direction, the Coriolis–Stokes forcing is perpendicular to the wave propagation direction (i.e. in the direction parallel to the wave crests ). In deep water the Stokes drift velocity is u S = c ( k a ) 2 exp ⁡ ( 2 k z ) {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {u}}_{S}={\boldsymbol {c}}\,(ka)^{2}\exp(2kz)} with c {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {c}}} the wave's phase velocity , k {\displaystyle k} the wavenumber , a {\displaystyle a} the wave amplitude and z {\displaystyle z} the vertical coordinate (positive in the upward direction opposing the gravitational acceleration).

This formation of craters lies nearly along the northwestern limb of the Moon , where their visibility is affected by libration effects. The rim of this crater has been heavily modified by nearby impacts, although it retains a somewhat circular character. Several small craters lie along the western outer ramparts, as well as along the ridge between Stokes and Langley. Much of the southern section of the floor has been covered by ejecta from nearby impacts. The northern half of the floor, however, is much more smooth and nearly featureless except for a few minor impacts. References [ edit ] Andersson, L. E.; Whitaker, E. A. (1982).

The wave steepness is: ka = 0.3, with k the wavenumber and a the wave amplitude . Typical for these surface gravity waves are the sharp crests and flat troughs . Model testing with periodic waves in the wave–tow tank of the Jere A. Chase Ocean Engineering Laboratory, University of New Hampshire . Undular bore and whelps near the mouth of Araguari River in north-eastern Brazil. View is oblique toward mouth from airplane at approximately 100 ft (30 m) altitude. [1] The undulations following behind the bore front appear as slowly modulated Stokes waves. In fluid dynamics , a Stokes wave is a nonlinear and periodic surface wave on an inviscid fluid layer of constant mean depth. This type of modelling has its origins in the mid 19th century when Sir George Stokes – using a perturbation series approach, now known as the Stokes expansion – obtained approximate solutions for nonlinear wave motion. Stokes's wave theory is of direct practical use for waves on intermediate and deep water. It is used in the design of coastal and offshore structures , in order to determine the wave kinematics ( free surface elevation and flow velocities ). The wave kinematics are subsequently needed in the design process to determine the wave loads on a structure. [2] For long waves (as compared to depth) – and using only a few terms in the Stokes expansion – its applicability is limited to waves of small amplitude . In such shallow water, a cnoidal wave theory often provides better periodic-wave approximations. While, in the strict sense, Stokes wave refers to a progressive periodic wave of permanent form, the term is also used in connection with standing waves [3] and even random waves. [4] [5] Examples [ edit ] The examples below describe Stokes waves under the action of gravity (without surface tension effects) in case of pure wave motion, so without an ambient mean current. Third-order Stokes wave on deep water [ edit ] Third-order Stokes wave in deep water under the action of gravity. The wave steepness is: ka = 0.3. The three harmonics contributing to the surface elevation of a deep water wave, according to Stokes's third-order theory. The wave steepness is: ka = 0.3. For visibility, the vertical scale is distorted by a factor of four, compared to the horizontal scale. Description: * the dark blue line is the surface elevation of the 3rd-order Stokes wave, * the black line is the fundamental wave component, with wavenumber k ( wavelength λ, k = 2 π / λ ), * the light blue line is the harmonic at 2 k (wavelength 1 ⁄ 2 λ), and * the red line is the harmonic at 3 k (wavelength 1 ⁄ 3 λ). According to Stokes's third-order theory, the free surface elevation η , the velocity potential Φ, the phase speed (or celerity) c and the wave phase θ are, for a progressive surface gravity wave on deep water – i.e. the fluid layer has infinite depth: [6] η ( x , t ) = a { [ 1 − 1 16 ( k a ) 2 ] cos ⁡ θ + 1 2 ( k a ) cos ⁡ 2 θ + 3 8 ( k a ) 2 cos ⁡ 3 θ } + O ( ( k a ) 4 ) , Φ ( x , z , t ) = a g k e k z sin ⁡ θ + O ( ( k a ) 4 ) , c = ω k = ( 1 + 1 2 ( k a ) 2 ) g k + O ( ( k a ) 4 ) , and θ ( x , t ) = k x − ω t , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\eta (x,t)=&a\left\{\left[1-{\tfrac {1}{16}}(ka)^{2}\right]\cos \theta +{\tfrac {1}{2}}(ka)\,\cos 2\theta +{\tfrac {3}{8}}(ka)^{2}\,\cos 3\theta \right\}+{\mathcal {O}}\left((ka)^{4}\right),\\\Phi (x,z,t)=&a{\sqrt {\frac {g}{k}}}\,{\text{e}}^{kz}\,\sin \theta +{\mathcal {O}}\left((ka)^{4}\right),\\c=&{\frac {\omega }{k}}=\left(1+{\tfrac {1}{2}}(ka)^{2}\right)\,{\sqrt {\frac {g}{k}}}+{\mathcal {O}}\left((ka)^{4}\right),{\text{ and}}\\\theta (x,t)=&kx-\omega t,\end{aligned}}} where x is the horizontal coordinate; z is the vertical coordinate, with the positive z -direction upward – opposing to the direction of the Earth's gravity – and z = 0 corresponding with the mean surface elevation; t is time; a is the first-order wave amplitude ; k is the angular wavenumber , k = 2 π / λ with λ being the wavelength ; ω is the angular frequency , ω = 2 π / τ where τ is the period , and g is the strength of the Earth's gravity, a constant in this approximation. The expansion parameter ka is known as the wave steepness. The phase speed increases with increasing nonlinearity ka of the waves. The wave height H , being the difference between the surface elevation η at a crest and a trough , is: [7] H = 2 a ( 1 + 3 8 k 2 a 2 ) . {\displaystyle H=2a\,\left(1+{\tfrac {3}{8}}\,k^{2}a^{2}\right).} Note that the second- and third-order terms in the velocity potential Φ are zero. Only at fourth order do contributions deviating from first-order theory – i.e. Airy wave theory – appear. [6] Up to third order the orbital velocity field u = ∇ Φ consists of a circular motion of the velocity vector at each position ( x , z ). As a result, the surface elevation of deep-water waves is to a good approximation trochoidal , as already noted by Stokes (1847) . [8] Stokes further observed, that although (in this Eulerian description) the third-order orbital velocity field consists of a circular motion at each point, the Lagrangian paths of fluid parcels are not closed circles. This is due to the reduction of the velocity amplitude at increasing depth below the surface. This Lagrangian drift of the fluid parcels is known as the Stokes drift . [8] Second-order Stokes wave on arbitrary depth [ edit ] The ratio S = a 2 / a of the amplitude a 2 of the harmonic with twice the wavenumber (2 k ), to the amplitude a of the fundamental , according to Stokes's second-order theory for surface gravity waves. On the horizontal axis is the relative water depth h / λ, with h the mean depth and λ the wavelength , while the vertical axis is the Stokes parameter S divided by the wave steepness ka (with k = 2 π / λ ). Description: * the blue line is valid for arbitrary water depth, while * the dashed red line is the shallow-water limit (water depth small compared to the wavelength), and * the dash-dot green line is the asymptotic limit for deep water waves. The surface elevation η and the velocity potential Φ are, according to Stokes's second-order theory of surface gravity waves on a fluid layer of mean depth h : [6] [9] η ( x , t ) = a { cos θ + k a 3 − σ 2 4 σ 3 cos 2 θ } + O ( ( k a ) 3 ) , Φ ( x , z , t ) = a ω k 1 sinh k h × { cosh k ( z + h ) sin θ + k a 3 cosh 2 k ( z + h ) 8 sinh 3 k h sin 2 θ } − ( k a ) 2 1 2 sinh 2 k h g t k + O ( ( k a ) 3 ) , c = ω k = g k σ + O ( ( k a ) 2 ) , σ = tanh k h and θ ( x , t ) = k x − ω t . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\eta (x,t)=&a\left\{\cos \,\theta +ka\,{\frac {3-\sigma ^{2}}{4\,\sigma ^{3}}}\,\cos \,2\theta \right\}+{\mathcal {O}}\left((ka)^{3}\right),\\\Phi (x,z,t)=&a\,{\frac {\omega }{k}}\,{\frac {1}{\sinh \,kh}}\\&\times \left\{\cosh \,k(z+h)\sin \,\theta +ka\,{\frac {3\cosh \,2k(z+h)}{8\,\sinh ^{3}\,kh}}\,\sin \,2\theta \right\}\\&-(ka)^{2}\,{\frac {1}{2\,\sinh \,2kh}}\,{\frac {g\,t}{k}}+{\mathcal {O}}\left((ka)^{3}\right),\\c=&{\frac {\omega }{k}}={\sqrt {{\frac {g}{k}}\,\sigma }}+{\mathcal {O}}\left((ka)^{2}\right),\\\sigma =&\tanh \,kh\quad {\text{and}}\quad \theta (x,t)=kx-\omega t.\end{aligned}}} Observe that for finite depth the velocity potential Φ contains a linear drift in time, independent of position ( x and z ). Both this temporal drift and the double-frequency term (containing sin 2θ) in Φ vanish for deep-water waves. Stokes and Ursell parameters [ edit ] Further information: Ursell parameter The ratio S of the free-surface amplitudes at second order and first order – according to Stokes's second-order theory – is: [6] S = k a 3 − tanh 2 k h 4 tanh 3 k h . {\displaystyle {\mathcal {S}}=ka\,{\frac {3-\tanh ^{2}\,kh}{4\,\tanh ^{3}\,kh}}.} In deep water, for large kh the ratio S has the asymptote lim k h → ∞ S = 1 2 k a . {\displaystyle \lim _{kh\to \infty }{\mathcal {S}}={\frac {1}{2}}\,ka.} For long waves, i.e. small kh , the ratio S behaves as lim k h ↓ 0 S = 3 4 k a ( k h ) 3 , {\displaystyle \lim _{kh\downarrow 0}{\mathcal {S}}={\frac {3}{4}}\,{\frac {ka}{(kh)^{3}}},} or, in terms of the wave height H = 2 a and wavelength λ = 2 π / k : lim k h ↓ 0 S = 3 32 π 2 H λ 2 h 3 = 3 32 π 2 U , {\displaystyle \lim _{kh\downarrow 0}{\mathcal {S}}={\frac {3}{32\,\pi ^{2}}}\,{\frac {H\,\lambda ^{2}}{h^{3}}}={\frac {3}{32\,\pi ^{2}}}\,{\mathcal {U}},} with U ≡ H λ 2 h 3 . {\displaystyle {\mathcal {U}}\equiv {\frac {H\,\lambda ^{2}}{h^{3}}}.} Here U is the Ursell parameter (or Stokes parameter). For long waves ( λ ≫ h ) of small height H , i.e. U ≪ 32π 2 /3 ≈ 100 , second-order Stokes theory is applicable. Otherwise, for fairly long waves ( λ > 7 h ) of appreciable height H a cnoidal wave description is more appropriate. [6] According to Hedges, fifth-order Stokes theory is applicable for U < 40 , and otherwise fifth-order cnoidal wave theory is preferable. [10] [11] Third-order dispersion relation [ edit ] Nonlinear enhancement of the phase speed c = ω / k – according to Stokes's third-order theory for surface gravity waves , and using Stokes's first definition of celerity – as compared to the linear-theory phase speed c 0 . On the horizontal axis is the relative water depth h / λ, with h the mean depth and λ the wavelength , while the vertical axis is the nonlinear phase-speed enhancement ( c − c 0 ) / c 0 divided by the wave steepness ka squared. Description: * the solid blue line is valid for arbitrary water depth, * the dashed red line is the shallow-water limit (water depth small compared to the wavelength), and * the dash-dot green line is the asymptotic limit for deep water waves. For Stokes waves under the action of gravity, the third-order dispersion relation is – according to Stokes's first definition of celerity : [9] ω 2 = ( g k tanh k h ) { 1 + 9 − 10 σ 2 + 9 σ 4 8 σ 4 ( k a ) 2 } + O ( ( k a ) 4 ) , with σ = tanh k h . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\omega ^{2}&=\left(gk\,\tanh \,kh\right)\;\left\{1+{\frac {9-10\,\sigma ^{2}+9\,\sigma ^{4}}{8\,\sigma ^{4}}}\,(ka)^{2}\right\}+{\mathcal {O}}\left((ka)^{4}\right),\\&\qquad {\text{with}}\\\sigma &=\tanh \,kh.\end{aligned}}} This third-order dispersion relation is a direct consequence of avoiding secular terms , when inserting the second-order Stokes solution into the third-order equations (of the perturbation series for the periodic wave problem). In deep water (short wavelength compared to the depth): lim k h → ∞ ω 2 = g k { 1 + ( k a ) 2 } + O ( ( k a ) 4 ) , {\displaystyle \lim _{kh\to \infty }\omega ^{2}=gk\,\left\{1+\left(ka\right)^{2}\right\}+{\mathcal {O}}\left((ka)^{4}\right),} and in shallow water (long wavelengths compared to the depth): lim k h ↓ 0 ω 2 = k 2 g h { 1 + 9 8 ( k a ) 2 ( k h ) 4 } + O ( ( k a ) 4 ) . {\displaystyle \lim _{kh\downarrow 0}\omega ^{2}=k^{2}\,gh\,\left\{1+{\frac {9}{8}}\,{\frac {\left(ka\right)^{2}}{\left(kh\right)^{4}}}\right\}+{\mathcal {O}}\left((ka)^{4}\right).} As shown above , the long-wave Stokes expansion for the dispersion relation will only be valid for small enough values of the Ursell parameter: U ≪ 100 . Overview [ edit ] Stokes's approach to the nonlinear wave problem [ edit ] Waves in the Kelvin wake pattern generated by a ship on the Maas–Waalkanaal in The Netherlands. The transverse waves in this Kelvin wake pattern are nearly plane Stokes waves. NOAA ship Delaware II in bad weather on Georges Bank . While these ocean waves are random , and not Stokes waves (in the strict sense), they indicate the typical sharp crests and flat troughs as found in nonlinear surface gravity waves. A fundamental problem in finding solutions for surface gravity waves is that boundary conditions have to be applied at the position of the free surface , which is not known beforehand and is thus a part of the solution to be found. Sir George Stokes solved this nonlinear wave problem in 1847 by expanding the relevant potential flow quantities in a Taylor series around the mean (or still) surface elevation. [12] As a result, the boundary conditions can be expressed in terms of quantities at the mean (or still) surface elevation (which is fixed and known). Next, a solution for the nonlinear wave problem (including the Taylor series expansion around the mean or still surface elevation) is sought by means of a perturbation series – known as the Stokes expansion – in terms of a small parameter, most often the wave steepness. The unknown terms in the expansion can be solved sequentially. [6] [8] Often, only a small number of terms is needed to provide a solution of sufficient accuracy for engineering purposes. [11] Typical applications are in the design of coastal and offshore structures , and of ships . Another property of nonlinear waves is that the phase speed of nonlinear waves depends on the wave height . In a perturbation-series approach, this easily gives rise to a spurious secular variation of the solution, in contradiction with the periodic behaviour of the waves. Stokes solved this problem by also expanding the dispersion relationship into a perturbation series, by a method now known as the Lindstedt–Poincaré method . [6] Applicability [ edit ] Validity of several theories for periodic water waves, according to Le Méhauté (1976). [13] The light-blue area gives the range of validity of cnoidal wave theory; light-yellow for Airy wave theory ; and the dashed blue lines demarcate between the required order in Stokes's wave theory. The light-gray shading gives the range extension by numerical approximations using fifth-order stream-function theory, for high waves ( H > 1 ⁄ 4 H breaking ). Stokes's wave theory , when using a low order of the perturbation expansion (e.g. up to second, third or fifth order), is valid for nonlinear waves on intermediate and deep water, that is for wavelengths ( λ ) not large as compared with the mean depth ( h ). In shallow water , the low-order Stokes expansion breaks down (gives unrealistic results) for appreciable wave amplitude (as compared to the depth). Then, Boussinesq approximations are more appropriate. Further approximations on Boussinesq-type (multi-directional) wave equations lead – for one-way wave propagation – to the Korteweg–de Vries equation or the Benjamin–Bona–Mahony equation . Like (near) exact Stokes-wave solutions, [14] these two equations have solitary wave ( soliton ) solutions, besides periodic-wave solutions known as cnoidal waves . [11] Modern extensions [ edit ] Already in 1914, Wilton extended the Stokes expansion for deep-water surface gravity waves to tenth order, although introducing errors at the eight order. [15] A fifth-order theory for finite depth was derived by De in 1955. [16] For engineering use, the fifth-order formulations of Fenton are convenient, applicable to both Stokes first and second definition of phase speed (celerity). [17] The demarcation between when fifth-order Stokes theory is preferable over fifth-order cnoidal wave theory is for Ursell parameters below about 40. [10] [11] Different choices for the frame of reference and expansion parameters are possible in Stokes-like approaches to the nonlinear wave problem. In 1880, Stokes himself inverted the dependent and independent variables, by taking the velocity potential and stream function as the independent variables, and the coordinates ( x , z ) as the dependent variables, with x and z being the horizontal and vertical coordinates respectively. [18] This has the advantage that the free surface, in a frame of reference in which the wave is steady (i.e. moving with the phase velocity), corresponds with a line on which the stream function is a constant. Then the free surface location is known beforehand, and not an unknown part of the solution. The disadvantage is that the radius of convergence of the rephrased series expansion reduces. [19] Another approach is by using the Lagrangian frame of reference , following the fluid parcels . The Lagrangian formulations show enhanced convergence, as compared to the formulations in both the Eulerian frame , and in the frame with the potential and streamfunction as independent variables. [20] [21] An exact solution for nonlinear pure capillary waves of permanent form, and for infinite fluid depth, was obtained by Crapper in 1957. Note that these capillary waves – being short waves forced by surface tension , if gravity effects are negligible – have sharp troughs and flat crests. This contrasts with nonlinear surface gravity waves, which have sharp crests and flat troughs. [22] Several integral properties of Stokes waves on deep water as a function of wave steepness. [23] The wave steepness is defined as the ratio of wave height H to the wavelength λ. The wave properties are made dimensionless using the wavenumber k = 2π / λ , gravitational acceleration g and the fluid density ρ . Shown are the kinetic energy density T , the potential energy density V , the total energy density E = T + V , the horizontal wave momentum density I , and the relative enhancement of the phase speed c . Wave energy densities T , V and E are integrated over depth and averaged over one wavelength, so they are energies per unit of horizontal area; the wave momentum density I is similar. The dashed black lines show 1/16 ( kH ) 2 and 1/8 ( kH ) 2 , being the values of the integral properties as derived from (linear) Airy wave theory . The maximum wave height occurs for a wave steepness H / λ ≈ 0.1412 , above which no periodic surface gravity waves exist. [24] Note that the shown wave properties have a maximum for a wave height less than the maximum wave height (see e.g. Longuet-Higgins 1975 ; Cokelet 1977 ). By use of computer models, the Stokes expansion for surface gravity waves has been continued, up to high (117th) order by Schwartz (1974) . Schwartz has found that the amplitude a (or a 1 ) of the first-order fundamental reaches a maximum before the maximum wave height H is reached. Consequently, the wave steepness ka in terms of wave amplitude is not a monotone function up to the highest wave, and Schwartz utilizes instead kH as the expansion parameter. To estimate the highest wave in deep water, Schwartz has used Padé approximants and Domb–Sykes plots in order to improve the convergence of the Stokes expansion. Extended tables of Stokes waves on various depths, computed by a different method (but in accordance with the results by others), are provided in Williams ( 1981 , 1985 ). Several exact relationships exist between integral properties – such as kinetic and potential energy , horizontal wave momentum and radiation stress – as found by Longuet-Higgins (1975) . He shows, for deep-water waves, that many of these integral properties have a maximum before the maximum wave height is reached (in support of Schwartz's findings). Cokelet (1978) harvtxt error: no target: CITEREFCokelet1978 ( help ) , using a method similar to the one of Schwartz, computed and tabulated integral properties for a wide range of finite water depths (all reaching maxima below the highest wave height). Further, these integral properties play an important role in the conservation laws for water waves, through Noether's theorem . [25] In 2005, Hammack, Henderson and Segur have provided the first experimental evidence for the existence of three-dimensional progressive waves of permanent form in deep water – that is bi-periodic and two-dimensional progressive wave patterns of permanent form. [26] The existence of these three-dimensional steady deep-water waves has been revealed in 2002, from a bifurcation study of two-dimensional Stokes waves by Craig and Nicholls, using numerical methods. [27] Convergence and instability [ edit ] Convergence [ edit ] Convergence of the Stokes expansion was first proved by Levi-Civita (1925) for the case of small-amplitude waves – on the free surface of a fluid of infinite depth. This was extended shortly afterwards by Struik (1926) for the case of finite depth and small-amplitude waves. [28] Near the end of the 20th century, it was shown that for finite-amplitude waves the convergence of the Stokes expansion depends strongly on the formulation of the periodic wave problem. For instance, an inverse formulation of the periodic wave problem as used by Stokes – with the spatial coordinates as a function of velocity potential and stream function – does not converge for high-amplitude waves. While other formulations converge much more rapidly, e.g. in the Eulerian frame of reference (with the velocity potential or stream function as a function of the spatial coordinates). [19] Highest wave [ edit ] Stokes waves of maximum wave height on deep water, under the action of gravity. The maximum wave steepness, for periodic and propagating deep-water waves, is H / λ = 0.1410633 ± 4 · 10 −7 , [29] so the wave height is about one-seventh ( ⁠ 1 / 7 ⁠ ) of the wavelength λ. [24] And surface gravity waves of this maximum height have a sharp wave crest – with an angle of 120° (in the fluid domain) – also for finite depth, as shown by Stokes in 1880. [18] An accurate estimate of the highest wave steepness in deep water ( H / λ ≈ 0.142 ) was already made in 1893, by John Henry Michell , using a numerical method. [30] A more detailed study of the behaviour of the highest wave near the sharp-cornered crest has been published by Malcolm A. Grant, in 1973. [31] The existence of the highest wave on deep water with a sharp-angled crest of 120° was proved by John Toland in 1978. [32] The convexity of η(x) between the successive maxima with a sharp-angled crest of 120° was independently proven by C.J. Amick et al. and Pavel I. Plotnikov in 1982 . [33] [34] The highest Stokes wave – under the action of gravity – can be approximated with the following simple and accurate representation of the free surface elevation η ( x , t ): [35] η λ = A [ cosh ( x − c t λ ) − 1 ] , {\displaystyle {\frac {\eta }{\lambda }}=A\,\left[\cosh \,\left({\frac {x-ct}{\lambda }}\right)-1\right],} with A = 1 3 sinh ⁡ ( 1 2 ) ≈ 1.108 , {\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{{\sqrt {3}}\,\sinh \left({\frac {1}{2}}\right)}}\approx 1.108,} for − 1 2 λ ≤ ( x − c t ) ≤ 1 2 λ , {\displaystyle -{\tfrac {1}{2}}\,\lambda \leq (x-ct)\leq {\tfrac {1}{2}}\,\lambda ,} and shifted horizontally over an integer number of wavelengths to represent the other waves in the regular wave train. This approximation is accurate to within 0.7% everywhere, as compared with the ""exact"" solution for the highest wave. [35] Another accurate approximation – however less accurate than the previous one – of the fluid motion on the surface of the steepest wave is by analogy with the swing of a pendulum in a grandfather clock . [36] Large library of Stokes waves computed with high precision for the case of infinite depth, represented with high accuracy (at least 27 digits after decimal point) as a Padé approximant can be found at StokesWave.org [37] Instability [ edit ] In deeper water, Stokes waves are unstable. [38] This was shown by T. Brooke Benjamin and Jim E. Feir in 1967. [39] [40] The Benjamin–Feir instability is a side-band or modulational instability, with the side-band modulations propagating in the same direction as the carrier wave ; waves become unstable on deeper water for a relative depth kh > 1.363 (with k the wavenumber and h the mean water depth). [41] The Benjamin–Feir instability can be described with the nonlinear Schrödinger equation , by inserting a Stokes wave with side bands. [38] Subsequently, with a more refined analysis, it has been shown – theoretically and experimentally – that the Stokes wave and its side bands exhibit Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou recurrence : a cyclic alternation between modulation and demodulation. [42] In 1978 Longuet-Higgins , by means of numerical modelling of fully non-linear waves and modulations (propagating in the carrier wave direction), presented a detailed analysis of the region of instability in deep water: both for superharmonics (for perturbations at the spatial scales smaller than the wavelength λ {\displaystyle \lambda } ) [43] and subharmonics (for perturbations at the spatial scales larger than λ {\displaystyle \lambda } ). [44] With increase of Stokes wave's amplitude, new modes of superharmonic instability appear. Appearance of a new branch of instability happens when the energy of the wave passes extremum. Detailed analysis of the mechanism of appearance of the new branches of instability has shown that their behavior follows closely a simple law, which allows to find with a good accuracy instability growth rates for all known and predicted branches. [45] In Longuet-Higgins studies of two-dimensional wave motion, as well as the subsequent studies of three-dimensional modulations by McLean et al., new types of instabilities were found – these are associated with resonant wave interactions between five (or more) wave components. [46] [47] [48] Stokes expansion [ edit ] Governing equations for a potential flow [ edit ] In many instances, the oscillatory flow in the fluid interior of surface waves can be described accurately using potential flow theory, apart from boundary layers near the free surface and bottom (where vorticity is important, due to viscous effects , see Stokes boundary layer ). [49] Then, the flow velocity u can be described as the gradient of a velocity potential Φ {\displaystyle \Phi } : u = ∇ Φ . {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} ={\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\Phi .} ( A ) Consequently, assuming incompressible flow , the velocity field u is divergence-free and the velocity potential Φ {\displaystyle \Phi } satisfies Laplace's equation [49] ∇ 2 Φ = 0 {\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}\Phi =0} ( B ) in the fluid interior. The fluid region is described using three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates ( x , y , z ), with x and y the horizontal coordinates, and z the vertical coordinate – with the positive z -direction opposing the direction of the gravitational acceleration . Time is denoted with t . The free surface is located at z = η ( x , y , t ) , and the bottom of the fluid region is at z = − h ( x , y ) . The free-surface boundary conditions for surface gravity waves – using a potential flow description – consist of a kinematic and a dynamic boundary condition. [50] The kinematic boundary condition ensures that the normal component of the fluid's flow velocity , u = [ ∂ Φ / ∂ x ∂ Φ / ∂ y ∂ Φ / ∂ z ] T {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} =[\partial \Phi /\partial x~~~\partial \Phi /\partial y~~~\partial \Phi /\partial z]^{\mathrm {T} }} in matrix notation, at the free surface equals the normal velocity component of the free-surface motion z = η ( x , y , t ) : ∂ η ∂ t + ∂ Φ ∂ x ∂ η ∂ x + ∂ Φ ∂ y ∂ η ∂ y = ∂ Φ ∂ z at z = η ( x , y , t ) . {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \eta }{\partial t}}+{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial x}}\,{\frac {\partial \eta }{\partial x}}+{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial y}}\,{\frac {\partial \eta }{\partial y}}={\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial z}}\qquad {\text{ at }}z=\eta (x,y,t).} ( C ) The dynamic boundary condition states that, without surface tension effects, the atmospheric pressure just above the free surface equals the fluid pressure just below the surface. For an unsteady potential flow this means that the Bernoulli equation is to be applied at the free surface. In case of a constant atmospheric pressure, the dynamic boundary condition becomes: ∂ Φ ∂ t + 1 2 | u | 2 + g η = 0 at z = η ( x , y , t ) , {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial t}}+{\tfrac {1}{2}}\,\left|\mathbf {u} \right|^{2}+g\,\eta =0\qquad {\text{ at }}z=\eta (x,y,t),} ( D ) where the constant atmospheric pressure has been taken equal to zero, without loss of generality . Both boundary conditions contain the potential Φ {\displaystyle \Phi } as well as the surface elevation η . A (dynamic) boundary condition in terms of only the potential Φ {\displaystyle \Phi } can be constructed by taking the material derivative of the dynamic boundary condition, and using the kinematic boundary condition: [49] [50] [51] ( ∂ ∂ t + u ⋅ ∇ ) ( ∂ Φ ∂ t + 1 2 | u | 2 + g η ) = 0 {\displaystyle {\color {Gray}{{\Bigl (}{\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}+\mathbf {u} \cdot {\boldsymbol {\nabla }}{\Bigr )}\,\left({\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial t}}+{\tfrac {1}{2}}\,|\mathbf {u} |^{2}+g\,\eta \right)=0}}} ⇒ ∂ 2 Φ ∂ t 2 + g ∂ Φ ∂ z + u ⋅ ∇ ∂ Φ ∂ t + 1 2 ∂ ∂ t ( | u | 2 ) + 1 2 u ⋅ ∇ ( | u | 2 ) = 0 {\displaystyle {\color {Gray}{\Rightarrow \quad {\frac {\partial ^{2}\Phi }{\partial t^{2}}}+g\,{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial z}}+\mathbf {u} \cdot {\boldsymbol {\nabla }}{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial t}}+{\tfrac {1}{2}}\,{\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}\left(|\mathbf {u} |^{2}\right)+{\tfrac {1}{2}}\,\mathbf {u} \cdot {\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\left(|\mathbf {u} |^{2}\right)=0}}} ⇒ ∂ 2 Φ ∂ t 2 + g ∂ Φ ∂ z + ∂ ∂ t ( | u | 2 ) + 1 2 u ⋅ ∇ ( | u | 2 ) = 0 at z = η ( x , y , t ) . {\displaystyle {\color {Gray}{\Rightarrow \quad }}{\frac {\partial ^{2}\Phi }{\partial t^{2}}}+g\,{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial z}}+{\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}\left(|\mathbf {u} |^{2}\right)+{\tfrac {1}{2}}\,\mathbf {u} \cdot {\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\left(|\mathbf {u} |^{2}\right)=0\qquad {\text{ at }}z=\eta (x,y,t).} ( E ) At the bottom of the fluid layer, impermeability requires the normal component of the flow velocity to vanish: [49] ∂ Φ ∂ n = 1 1 + ( ∂ h ∂ x ) 2 + ( ∂ h ∂ y ) 2 { ∂ Φ ∂ z + ∂ h ∂ x ∂ Φ ∂ x + ∂ h ∂ y ∂ Φ ∂ y } = 0 , at z = − h ( x , y ) , {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial n}}={\frac {1}{\sqrt {1+\left({\frac {\partial h}{\partial x}}\right)^{2}+\left({\frac {\partial h}{\partial y}}\right)^{2}}}}\,\left\{{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial z}}+{\frac {\partial h}{\partial x}}\,{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial x}}+{\frac {\partial h}{\partial y}}\,{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial y}}\right\}=0,\qquad {\text{ at }}z=-h(x,y),} ( F ) where h ( x , y ) is the depth of the bed below the datum z = 0 and n is the coordinate component in the direction normal to the bed . For permanent waves above a horizontal bed, the mean depth h is a constant and the boundary condition at the bed becomes: ∂ Φ ∂ z = 0 at z = − h . {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial z}}=0\qquad {\text{ at }}z=-h.} Taylor series in the free-surface boundary conditions [ edit ] The free-surface boundary conditions (D) and (E) apply at the yet unknown free-surface elevation z = η ( x , y , t ) . They can be transformed into boundary conditions at a fixed elevation z = constant by use of Taylor series expansions of the flow field around that elevation. [49] Without loss of generality the mean surface elevation – around which the Taylor series are developed – can be taken at z = 0 . This assures the expansion is around an elevation in the proximity of the actual free-surface elevation. Convergence of the Taylor series for small-amplitude steady-wave motion was proved by Levi-Civita (1925) . The following notation is used: the Taylor series of some field f ( x , y , z , t ) around z = 0 – and evaluated at z = η ( x , y , t ) – is: [52] f ( x , y , η , t ) = [ f ] 0 + η [ ∂ f ∂ z ] 0 + 1 2 η 2 [ ∂ 2 f ∂ z 2 ] 0 + ⋯ {\displaystyle f(x,y,\eta ,t)=\left[f\right]_{0}+\eta \,\left[{\frac {\partial f}{\partial z}}\right]_{0}+{\frac {1}{2}}\,\eta ^{2}\,\left[{\frac {\partial ^{2}f}{\partial z^{2}}}\right]_{0}+\cdots } with subscript zero meaning evaluation at z = 0 , e.g.: [ f ] 0 = f ( x , y ,0, t ) . Applying the Taylor expansion to free-surface boundary condition Eq. (E) in terms of the potential Φ gives: [49] [52] [ ∂ 2 Φ ∂ t 2 + g ∂ Φ ∂ z ] 0 + η [ ∂ ∂ z ( ∂ 2 Φ ∂ t 2 + g ∂ Φ ∂ z ) ] 0 + [ ∂ ∂ t ( | u | 2 ) ] 0 + 1 2 η 2 [ ∂ 2 ∂ z 2 ( ∂ 2 Φ ∂ t 2 + g ∂ Φ ∂ z ) ] 0 + η [ ∂ 2 ∂ t ∂ z ( | u | 2 ) ] 0 + [ 1 2 u ⋅ ∇ ( | u | 2 ) ] 0 + ⋯ = 0 , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&\left[{\frac {\partial ^{2}\Phi }{\partial t^{2}}}+g\,{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial z}}\right]_{0}+\eta \left[{\frac {\partial }{\partial z}}\left({\frac {\partial ^{2}\Phi }{\partial t^{2}}}+g\,{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial z}}\right)\right]_{0}+\left[{\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}\left(|\mathbf {u} |^{2}\right)\right]_{0}\\&\quad +{\tfrac {1}{2}}\,\eta ^{2}\left[{\frac {\partial ^{2}}{\partial z^{2}}}\left({\frac {\partial ^{2}\Phi }{\partial t^{2}}}+g\,{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial z}}\right)\right]_{0}+\eta \left[{\frac {\partial ^{2}}{\partial t\,\partial z}}\left(|\mathbf {u} |^{2}\right)\right]_{0}+\left[{\tfrac {1}{2}}\,\mathbf {u} \cdot {\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\left(|\mathbf {u} |^{2}\right)\right]_{0}\\&\quad +\cdots =0,\end{aligned}}} ( G ) showing terms up to triple products of η , Φ and u , as required for the construction of the Stokes expansion up to third-order O (( ka ) 3 ). Here, ka is the wave steepness, with k a characteristic wavenumber and a a characteristic wave amplitude for the problem under study. The fields η , Φ and u are assumed to be O ( ka ). The dynamic free-surface boundary condition Eq. (D) can be evaluated in terms of quantities at z = 0 as: [49] [52] [ ∂ Φ ∂ t + g η ] 0 + η [ ∂ 2 Φ ∂ t ∂ z ] 0 + [ 1 2 | u | 2 ] 0 + 1 2 η 2 [ ∂ 3 Φ ∂ t ∂ z 2 ] 0 + η [ ∂ ∂ z ( 1 2 | u | 2 ) ] 0 + ⋯ = 0. {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&\left[{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial t}}+g\,\eta \right]_{0}+\eta \left[{\frac {\partial ^{2}\Phi }{\partial t\,\partial z}}\right]_{0}+{\biggl [}{\tfrac {1}{2}}\,\left|\mathbf {u} \right|^{2}{\biggr ]}_{0}\\&\quad +{\tfrac {1}{2}}\,\eta ^{2}\left[{\frac {\partial ^{3}\Phi }{\partial t\,\partial z^{2}}}\right]_{0}+\eta \left[{\frac {\partial }{\partial z}}\left({\tfrac {1}{2}}\,\left|\mathbf {u} \right|^{2}\right)\right]_{0}+\cdots =0.\end{aligned}}} ( H ) The advantages of these Taylor-series expansions fully emerge in combination with a perturbation-series approach, for weakly non-linear waves ( ka ≪ 1) . Perturbation-series approach [ edit ] The perturbation series are in terms of a small ordering parameter ε ≪ 1 – which subsequently turns out to be proportional to (and of the order of) the wave slope ka , see the series solution in this section . [53] So, take ε = ka : η = ε η 1 + ε 2 η 2 + ε 3 η 3 + ⋯ , Φ = ε Φ 1 + ε 2 Φ 2 + ε 3 Φ 3 + ⋯ and u = ε u 1 + ε 2 u 2 + ε 3 u 3 + ⋯ . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\eta &=\varepsilon \,\eta _{1}+\varepsilon ^{2}\,\eta _{2}+\varepsilon ^{3}\,\eta _{3}+\cdots ,\\\Phi &=\varepsilon \,\Phi _{1}+\varepsilon ^{2}\,\Phi _{2}+\varepsilon ^{3}\,\Phi _{3}+\cdots \quad {\text{and}}\\\mathbf {u} &=\varepsilon \,\mathbf {u} _{1}+\varepsilon ^{2}\,\mathbf {u} _{2}+\varepsilon ^{3}\,\mathbf {u} _{3}+\cdots .\end{aligned}}} When applied in the flow equations, they should be valid independent of the particular value of ε . By equating in powers of ε , each term proportional to ε to a certain power has to equal to zero. As an example of how the perturbation-series approach works, consider the non-linear boundary condition (G) ; it becomes: [6] ε { ∂ 2 Φ 1 ∂ t 2 + g ∂ Φ 1 ∂ z } + ε 2 { ∂ 2 Φ 2 ∂ t 2 + g ∂ Φ 2 ∂ z + η

the water depth, for three successive wave periods . The wave height is about 9.2% of the wavelength . Description of the animation : The white dots are fluid particles, followed in time. In the case shown here, the mean Eulerian horizontal velocity below the wave trough is zero. [54] The waves of permanent form propagate with a constant phase velocity (or celerity ), denoted as c . If the steady wave motion is in the horizontal x -direction, the flow quantities η and u are not separately dependent on x and time t , but are functions of x − ct : [55] η ( x , t ) = η ( x − c t ) and u ( x , z , t ) = u ( x − c t , z ) . {\displaystyle \eta (x,t)=\eta (x-ct)\quad {\text{and}}\quad \mathbf {u} (x,z,t)=\mathbf {u} (x-ct,z).} Further the waves are periodic – and because they are also of permanent form – both in horizontal space x and in time t , with wavelength λ and period τ respectively. Note that Φ ( x , z , t ) itself is not necessary periodic due to the possibility of a constant (linear) drift in x and/or t : [56] Φ ( x , z , t ) = β x − γ t + φ ( x − c t , z ) , {\displaystyle \Phi (x,z,t)=\beta x-\gamma t+\varphi (x-ct,z),} with φ ( x , z , t ) – as well as the derivatives ∂ Φ /∂ t and ∂ Φ /∂ x – being periodic. Here β is the mean flow velocity below trough level, and γ is related to the hydraulic head as observed in a frame of reference moving with the wave's phase velocity c (so the flow becomes steady in this reference frame). In order to apply the Stokes expansion to progressive periodic waves, it is advantageous to describe them through Fourier series as a function of the wave phase θ ( x , t ): [48] [56] θ = k x − ω t = k ( x − c t ) , {\displaystyle \theta =kx-\omega t=k\left(x-ct\right),} assuming waves propagating in the x –direction. Here k = 2 π / λ is the wavenumber , ω = 2 π / τ is the angular frequency and c = ω / k (= λ / τ ) is the phase velocity . Now, the free surface elevation η ( x , t ) of a periodic wave can be described as the Fourier series : [11] [56] η = ∑ n = 1 ∞ A n cos ( n θ ) . {\displaystyle \eta =\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }A_{n}\,\cos \,(n\theta ).} Similarly, the corresponding expression for the velocity potential Φ ( x , z , t ) is: [56] Φ = β x − γ t + ∑ n = 1 ∞ B n [ cosh ( n k ( z + h ) ) ] sin ( n θ ) , {\displaystyle \Phi =\beta x-\gamma t+\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }B_{n}\,{\biggl [}\cosh \,\left(nk\,(z+h)\right){\biggr ]}\,\sin \,(n\theta ),} satisfying both the Laplace equation ∇ 2 Φ = 0 in the fluid interior, as well as the boundary condition ∂ Φ /∂ z = 0 at the bed z = − h . For a given value of the wavenumber k , the parameters: A n , B n (with n = 1, 2, 3, ... ), c , β and γ have yet to be determined. They all can be expanded as perturbation series in ε . Fenton (1990) provides these values for fifth-order Stokes's wave theory. For progressive periodic waves, derivatives with respect to x and t of functions f ( θ , z ) of θ ( x , t ) can be expressed as derivatives with respect to θ : ∂ f ∂ x = + k ∂ f ∂ θ and ∂ f ∂ t = − ω ∂ f ∂ θ . {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}=+k\,{\frac {\partial f}{\partial \theta }}\qquad {\text{and}}\qquad {\frac {\partial f}{\partial t}}=-\omega \,{\frac {\partial f}{\partial \theta }}.} The important point for non-linear waves – in contrast to linear Airy wave theory – is that the phase velocity c also depends on the wave amplitude a , besides its dependence on wavelength λ = 2π / k and mean depth h . Negligence of the dependence of c on wave amplitude results in the appearance of secular terms , in the higher-order contributions to the perturbation-series solution. Stokes (1847) already applied the required non-linear correction to the phase speed c in order to prevent secular behaviour. A general approach to do so is now known as the Lindstedt–Poincaré method . Since the wavenumber k is given and thus fixed, the non-linear behaviour of the phase velocity c = ω / k is brought into account by also expanding the angular frequency ω into a perturbation series: [9] ω = ω 0 + ε ω 1 + ε 2 ω 2 + ⋯ . {\displaystyle \omega =\omega _{0}+\varepsilon \,\omega _{1}+\varepsilon ^{2}\,\omega _{2}+\cdots .} Here ω 0 will turn out to be related to the wavenumber k through the linear dispersion relation . However time derivatives, through ∂ f /∂ t = − ω ∂ f /∂ θ , now also give contributions – containing ω 1 , ω 2 , etc. – to the governing equations at higher orders in the perturbation series. By tuning ω 1 , ω 2 , etc., secular behaviour can be prevented. For surface gravity waves, it is found that ω 1 = 0 and the first non-zero contribution to the dispersion relation comes from ω 2 (see e.g. the sub-section "" Third-order dispersion relation "" above). [9] Stokes's two definitions of wave celerity [ edit ] For non-linear surface waves there is, in general, ambiguity in splitting the total motion into a wave part and a mean part. As a consequence, there is some freedom in choosing the phase speed (celerity) of the wave. Stokes (1847) identified two logical definitions of phase speed, known as Stokes's first and second definition of wave celerity: [6] [11] [57] Stokes's first definition of wave celerity has, for a pure wave motion, the mean value of the horizontal Eulerian flow-velocity Ū E at any location below trough level equal to zero. Due to the irrotationality of potential flow, together with the horizontal sea bed and periodicity the mean horizontal velocity, the mean horizontal velocity is a constant between bed and trough level. So in Stokes first definition the wave is considered from a frame of reference moving with the mean horizontal velocity Ū E . This is an advantageous approach when the mean Eulerian flow velocity Ū E is known, e.g. from measurements. Stokes's second definition of wave celerity is for a frame of reference where the mean horizontal mass transport of the wave motion equal to zero. This is different from the first definition due to the mass transport in the splash zone , i.e. between the trough and crest level, in the wave propagation direction. This wave-induced mass transport is caused by the positive correlation between surface elevation and horizontal velocity. In the reference frame for Stokes's second definition, the wave-induced mass transport is compensated by an opposing undertow (so Ū E < 0 for waves propagating in the positive x -direction). This is the logical definition for waves generated in a wave flume in the laboratory, or waves moving perpendicular towards a beach. As pointed out by Michael E. McIntyre , the mean horizontal mass transport will be (near) zero for a wave group approaching into still water, with also in deep water the mass transport caused by the waves balanced by an opposite mass transport in a return flow (undertow). [58] This is due to the fact that otherwise a large mean force will be needed to accelerate the body of water into which the wave group is propagating.

In deep(er) water, the characteristic wavelength is the only length scale available. So, the horizontal and vertical coordinates are all non-dimensionalized with the wavelength. This leads to Stokes wave theory. However, in shallow water, the water depth is the appropriate characteristic scale to make the vertical coordinate non-dimensional, while the horizontal coordinates are scaled with the wavelength – resulting in the Boussinesq approximation .

For the medieval Anglo-Irish, see Old English (Ireland) . For the bank, see Anglo Irish Bank . For Anglo-Irish poetry, see Irish poetry . Ethnic group Anglo-Irish Angla-Éireannach St Patrick's Cross is often seen as a symbol of the Anglo-Irish. Regions with significant populations Northern Ireland 407,454 [1] [2] ( Northern Irish Anglicans ) ( Northern Irish Methodists ) ( Other Northern Irish Protestants ) Republic of Ireland 177,200 [3] ( Irish Anglicans ) ( Irish Methodists ) ( Other Irish Protestants ) Languages Standard English , Hiberno-English , Northern Ireland Sign Religion Anglicanism (some Methodist , Catholic or other Protestant) (see also Religion in Ireland ) Related ethnic groups English • Scots • Anglo-Normans • Anglo-Saxons • Ulster Scots • Ulster Protestants • Welsh Anglo-Irish people ( Irish : Angla-Éireannach ) denotes an ethnic, social and religious grouping who are mostly the descendants and successors of the English Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland. [4] They mostly belong to the Anglican Church of Ireland , which was the established church of Ireland until 1871, or to a lesser extent one of the English dissenting churches, such as the Methodist church , though some were Roman Catholics . They often defined themselves as simply ""British"", and less frequently ""Anglo-Irish"", ""Irish"" or ""English"". [5] Many became eminent as administrators in the British Empire and as senior army and naval officers since the Kingdom of England and Great Britain were in a real union with the Kingdom of Ireland for over a century, before politically uniting into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801. The term is not usually applied to Presbyterians in the province of Ulster , whose ancestry is mostly Lowland Scottish , rather than English or Irish, and who are sometimes identified as Ulster-Scots or Orangemen. The Anglo-Irish hold a wide range of political views, with some being outspoken Irish Nationalists , but most overall being Unionists . And while most of the Anglo-Irish originated in the English diaspora in Ireland, others were descended from families of the old Gaelic nobility of Ireland . [6] As a social class [ edit ] See also: Protestant Ascendancy The term ""Anglo-Irish"" is often applied to the members of the Church of Ireland who made up the professional and landed class in Ireland from the 17th century up to the time of Irish independence in the early 20th century. In the course of the 17th century , this Anglo-Irish landed class replaced the Gaelic Irish and Old English aristocracies as the ruling class in Ireland. They were also referred to as "" New English "" to distinguish them from the ""Old English"", who descended from the medieval Hiberno-Norman settlers. Under the Penal Laws , which were in force between the 17th and 19th centuries (although enforced with varying degrees of severity), Roman Catholic recusants in Great Britain and Ireland were barred from holding public office, while in Ireland they were also barred from entry to Trinity College Dublin and from professions such as law, medicine, and the military . The lands of the recusant Roman Catholic landed gentry who refused to take the prescribed oaths were largely confiscated during the Plantations of Ireland . The rights of Roman Catholics to inherit landed property were severely restricted. Those who converted to the Church of Ireland were usually able to keep or regain their lost property, as the issue was considered primarily one of allegiance. In the late 18th century, the Parliament of Ireland in Dublin won legislative independence, and the movement for the repeal of the Test Acts began. Marble bust of The V. Rev. Jonathan Swift , inside St Patrick's Cathedral , Dublin . Swift was Dean of St Patrick's from 1713 to 1745. Not all Anglo-Irish people could trace their origins to the Protestant English settlers of the Cromwellian period; some were of Welsh stock, and others descended from Old English or even native Gaelic converts to Anglicanism. [6] Members of this ruling class commonly identified themselves as Irish, [5] while retaining English habits in politics, commerce, and culture. They participated in the popular English sports of the day, particularly racing and fox hunting , and intermarried with the ruling classes in Great Britain. Many of the more successful of them spent much of their careers either in Great Britain or in some part of the British Empire . Many constructed large country houses , which became known in Ireland as Big Houses , and these became symbolic of the class' dominance in Irish society. The Dublin working class playwright Brendan Behan , a staunch Irish Republican , saw the Anglo-Irish as Ireland's leisure class and famously defined an Anglo-Irishman as ""a Protestant with a horse"". [7] The Anglo-Irish novelist and short story writer Elizabeth Bowen memorably described her experience as feeling ""English in Ireland, Irish in England"" and not accepted fully as belonging to either. [8] Due to their prominence in the military and their conservative politics, the Anglo-Irish have been compared to the Prussian Junker class by, among others, Correlli Barnett . [9] Business interests [ edit ] At the beginning of the 20th century, the Anglo-Irish owned many of the major indigenous businesses in Ireland, such as Jacob's Biscuits , Bewley's , Beamish and Crawford , Jameson's Whiskey , W. P. & R. Odlum , Cleeve's , R&H Hall , Maguire & Patterson , Dockrell's , Arnott's , Goulding Chemicals , the Irish Times , the Irish Railways, and the Guinness brewery , Ireland's largest employer. [ citation needed ] They also controlled financial companies such as the Bank of Ireland and Goodbody Stockbrokers . Statue of Anglo-Irish mathematician and theologian George Salmon (1819–1904), in front of the campanile of Trinity College Dublin , the traditional alma mater of the Anglo-Irish class. Salmon was provost of Trinity from 1888 until his death. Prominent members [ edit ] Prominent Anglo-Irish poets, writers, and playwrights include Oscar Wilde , Maria Edgeworth , Jonathan Swift , George Berkeley , Sheridan Le Fanu , Oliver Goldsmith , Laurence Sterne , George Darley , Lucy Knox , Bram Stoker , J. M. Synge , W. B. Yeats , Cecil Day-Lewis , Bernard Shaw , Augusta, Lady Gregory , Samuel Beckett , Giles Cooper , C. S. Lewis , Lord Longford , Elizabeth Bowen , William Trevor and William Allingham . The writer Lafcadio Hearn was of Anglo-Irish descent on his father's side but was brought up as a Catholic by his great-aunt. In the 19th century, some of the most prominent mathematical and physical scientists of the British Isles, including Sir William Rowan Hamilton , Sir George Stokes , John Tyndall , George Johnstone Stoney , Thomas Romney Robinson , Edward Sabine , Thomas Andrews , Lord Rosse , George Salmon , and George FitzGerald , were Anglo-Irish. In the 20th century, scientists John Joly and Ernest Walton were also Anglo-Irish, as was the polar explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton . Medical experts included Sir William Wilde , Robert Graves , Thomas Wrigley Grimshaw , William Stokes , Robert Collis , Sir John Lumsden and William Babington . The geographer William Cooley was one of the first to describe the process of globalization . The Anglo-Irishmen Richard Brinsley Sheridan , Henry Grattan , Lord Castlereagh , George Canning , Lord Macartney , Thomas Spring Rice , Charles Stewart Parnell , and Edward Carson played major roles in British politics. Downing Street itself was named after Sir George Downing . In the Church, Bishop Richard Pococke contributed much to C18 travel writing. The Anglo-Irish were also represented among the senior officers of the British Army by men such as Field Marshal Earl Roberts , first honorary Colonel of the Irish Guards regiment, who spent most of his career in British India ; Field Marshal Viscount Gough , who served under Wellington , himself a Wellesley born in Dublin to the Earl of Mornington , head of a prominent Anglo-Irish family in Dublin; and in the 20th century Field Marshal Lord Alanbrooke , Field Marshal Lord Alexander of Tunis , General Sir John Winthrop Hackett , Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson and Field Marshal Sir Garnet Wolseley . (see also Irish military diaspora ). Others were prominent officials and administrators in the British Empire , such as: Frederick Matthew Darley , the Chief Justice of New South Wales; Henry Arthur Blake , Antony MacDonnell and Gavan Duffy . Others were involved in finding better ways of managing it, heading the Donoughmore Commission or the Moyne Commission . Sir John Winthrop Hackett emigrated to Australia where he became the proprietor and editor of many prominent newspapers. He was also influential in the founding of the University of Western Australia and was its first chancellor. Prolific art music composers included Michael William Balfe , John Field , George Alexander Osborne , Thomas Roseingrave , Charles Villiers Stanford , John Andrew Stevenson , Robert Prescott Stewart , William Vincent Wallace , and Charles Wood . In the visual arts , sculptor John Henry Foley , art dealer Hugh Lane , artists Daniel Maclise , William Orpen and Jack Yeats ; ballerina Dame Ninette de Valois and designer-architect Eileen Gray were famous outside Ireland. William Desmond Taylor was an early and prolific maker of silent films in Hollywood . Scriptwriter Johanna Harwood penned several of the early James Bond films, among others. Philanthropists included Thomas Barnardo and Lord Iveagh . Confederate general Patrick Cleburne was of Anglo-Irish ancestry. Discussing what he considered the lack of Irish civic morality in 2011, former Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald remarked that before 1922: ""In Ireland a strong civic sense did exist – but mainly amongst Protestants and especially Anglicans"". [10] Henry Ford , the American industrialist and business magnate , was half Anglo-Irish; his father William Ford was born in Cork to a family originally from Somerset , England. [11] Attitude towards Ireland's independence [ edit ] The Anglo-Irish, as a class, were mostly opposed to the notions of Irish independence and Home Rule . [12] Most were supporters of continued political union with Great Britain , which existed between 1800 and 1922. This was for many reasons, but most important were the economic benefits of union for the landowning class, the close personal and familial relations with the British establishment, and the political prominence held by the Anglo-Irish in Ireland under the union settlement. [13] Many Anglo-Irish men served as officers in the British Army , were clergymen in the established Anglican Church of Ireland or had land (or business interests) across the British Isles – all factors which encouraged political support for unionism . Between the mid-nineteenth century and 1922, the Anglo-Irish comprised the bulk of the support for movements such as the Irish Unionist Alliance , especially in the southern three provinces of Ireland. [14] During World War I , Irish nationalist MP Tom Kettle compared the Anglo-Irish landlord class to the Prussian Junkers , saying, ""England goes to fight for liberty in Europe and for junkerdom in Ireland ."" [15] However, Protestants in Ireland, and the Anglo-Irish class in particular, were by no means universally attached to the cause of continued political union with Great Britain. For instance, author Jonathan Swift (1667–1745), a clergyman in the Church of Ireland, vigorously denounced the plight of ordinary Irish Catholics under the rule of the landlords. Reformist politicians such as Henry Grattan (1746–1820), Wolfe Tone (1763–1798), Robert Emmet (1778–1803), Sir John Gray (1815–1875), and Charles Stewart Parnell (1846–1891), were also Protestant nationalists , and in large measure led and defined Irish nationalism. The Irish Rebellion of 1798 was led by members of the Anglo-Irish and Ulster Scots class, some of whom feared the political implications of the impending union with Great Britain. [16] By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, however, Irish nationalism became increasingly tied to a Roman Catholic identity. [16] By the beginning of the twentieth century, many Anglo-Irishmen in southern Ireland had become convinced of the need for a political settlement with Irish nationalists. Anglo-Irish politicians such as Sir Horace Plunkett and Lord Monteagle became leading figures in finding a peaceful solution to the 'Irish question'. During the Irish War of Independence (1919–1921), many Anglo-Irish landlords left the country due to arson attacks on their family homes . [17] The burnings continued and many sectarian murders were carried out by the Anti-Treaty IRA during the Irish Civil War . Considering the Irish State unable to protect them, many members of the Anglo-Irish class subsequently left Ireland forever, fearing that they would be subject to discriminatory legislation and social pressures. The Protestant proportion of the Irish population dropped from 10% (300,000) to 6% (180,000) in the Irish Free State in the twenty-five years following independence, [18] with most resettling in Great Britain . In the whole of Ireland the percentage of Protestants was 26% (1.1 million). The reaction of the Anglo-Irish to the Anglo-Irish Treaty which envisaged the establishment of the Irish Free State was mixed. J. A. F. Gregg , the Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin , stated in a sermon in December 1921 (the month the Treaty was signed): It concerns us all to offer the Irish Free State our loyalty. I believe there is a genuine desire on the part of those who have long differed from us politically to welcome our co-operation. We should be wrong politically and religiously to reject such advances. [19] In 1925, when the Irish Free State was poised to outlaw divorce , the Anglo-Irish poet W. B. Yeats delivered a famous eulogy for his class in the Irish Senate : I think it is tragic that within three years of this country gaining its independence we should be discussing a measure which a minority of this nation considers to be grossly oppressive. I am proud to consider myself a typical man of that minority. We against whom you have done this thing, are no petty people. We are one of the great stocks of Europe. We are the people of Burke ; we are the people of Grattan ; we are the people of Swift , the people of Emmet , the people of Parnell . We have created the most of the modern literature of this country. We have created the best of its political intelligence. Yet I do not altogether regret what has happened. I shall be able to find out, if not I, my children will be able to find out whether we have lost our stamina or not. You have defined our position and have given us a popular following. If we have not lost our stamina then your victory will be brief, and your defeat final, and when it comes this nation may be transformed. [20] Peerage [ edit ] See also: Irish House of Lords and Peerage of Ireland Following the English victory in the Nine Years' War (1594–1603), the "" Flight of the Earls "" in 1607, the traditional Gaelic Irish nobility was displaced in Ireland, particularly in the Cromwellian period. By 1707, after further defeat in the Williamite War and the subsequent Union of England and Scotland, the aristocracy in Ireland was dominated by Anglican families who owed allegiance to the Crown. Some of these were Irish families who had chosen to conform to the established Church of Ireland , keeping their lands and privileges, such as the Dukes of Leinster (whose surname is FitzGerald , and who descend from the Hiberno-Norman aristocracy), or the Gaelic Guinness family . Some were families of British or mixed-British ancestry who owed their status in Ireland to the Crown, such as the Earls of Cork (whose surname is Boyle and whose ancestral roots were in Herefordshire , England). Among the prominent Anglo-Irish peers are: Field Marshal Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington , from a portrait by Sir Thomas Lawrence The 1st Earl of Cork , Lord High Treasurer of Ireland , father of scientist Robert Boyle . The 1st Baron Glenavy , second-last Lord Chancellor of Ireland and first Cathoirleach (or Chairman) of the Irish Senate (1922). The 8th Marquess Conyngham , owner of the Slane Castle rock venue and candidate for Fine Gael in recent Irish general elections . The 3rd Earl of Iveagh , of Gaelic Irish descent; head of the Guinness family who sat in the Irish Senate (1973–1977). Valerie, Lady Goulding , founder of the Rehabilitation Institute and close associate of former Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Charles Haughey . The 6th Earl of Longford , Impresario at the Gate Theatre in Dublin in the 1950s. The 7th Earl of Longford (who succeeded his brother (above) in the Earldom), British Labour Cabinet minister, biographer and friend of Éamon de Valera . The 3rd Earl of Rosse , astronomer and builder of the then-largest telescope in the world. The 18th Baron of Dunsany , author. Edmond Roche, 1st Baron Fermoy , Irish peer . The 1st Duke of Ormonde , 17th-century statesman, served as Lord Deputy of Ireland on two occasions and commanded Royalist forces in Ireland in the Irish Confederate Wars negotiating with the Irish Confederates on behalf of Charles I . Murrough, 1st Earl of Inchiquin , 6th Baron Inchiquin (1618–1674), of Gaelic Irish descent; a Parliamentary commander in the Irish Confederate Wars (1644–1648) before changing sides to become one of the leaders of the Royalist troops in Ireland during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland (1649–53). Field Marshal The 1st Duke of Wellington , Anglo-Irish general who fought many successful campaigns and defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo . He later became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Until the year 1800, the peers of Ireland were all entitled to a seat in the Irish House of Lords , the upper house of the Parliament of Ireland , in Dublin . After 1800, under the provisions of the Act of Union , the Parliament of Ireland was abolished and the Irish peers were entitled to elect twenty-eight of their number to sit in the British House of Lords , in London, as Irish representative peers . During the Georgian Era , titles in the peerage of Ireland were often granted by the British monarch to Englishmen with little or no connection to Ireland, as a way of preventing such honours from inflating the membership of the British House of Lords. [21] A number of Anglo-Irish peers have been appointed by Presidents of Ireland to serve on their advisory Council of State . Some were also considered possible candidates for presidents of Ireland, including: Valerie, Lady Goulding Lord Killanin (though an Irish Catholic, rather than Anglo-Irish despite his peerage) Lord Ashbourne (a renowned Gaelic scholar).

Orange and green trajectories are for small and large Stokes numbers, respectively. Orange curve is trajectory of particle with Stokes number less than one that follows the streamlines (blue), while green curve is for a Stokes number greater than one, and so the particle does not follow the streamlines. That particle collides with one of the obstacles (brown circles) at point shown in yellow. The Stokes number ( Stk ), named after George Gabriel Stokes , is a dimensionless number characterising the behavior of particles suspended in a fluid flow . The Stokes number is defined as the ratio of the characteristic time of a particle (or droplet ) to a characteristic time of the flow or of an obstacle, or S t k = t 0 u 0 l 0 {\displaystyle \mathrm {Stk} ={\frac {t_{0}\,u_{0}}{l_{0}}}} where t 0 {\displaystyle t_{0}} is the relaxation time of the particle (the time constant in the exponential decay of the particle velocity due to drag), u 0 {\displaystyle u_{0}} is the fluid velocity of the flow well away from the obstacle, and l 0 {\displaystyle l_{0}} is the characteristic dimension of the obstacle (typically its diameter) or a characteristic length scale in the flow (like boundary layer thickness). [1] A particle with a low Stokes number follows fluid streamlines (perfect advection ), while a particle with a large Stokes number is dominated by its inertia and continues along its initial trajectory. In the case of Stokes flow , which is when the particle (or droplet) Reynolds number is less than about one, the particle drag coefficient is inversely proportional to the Reynolds number itself. In that case, the characteristic time of the particle can be written as t 0 = ρ p d p 2 18 μ g {\displaystyle t_{0}={\frac {\rho _{p}d_{p}^{2}}{18\mu _{g}}}} where ρ p {\displaystyle \rho _{p}} is the particle density , d p {\displaystyle d_{p}} is the particle diameter and μ g {\displaystyle \mu _{g}} is the fluid dynamic viscosity . [2] In experimental fluid dynamics, the Stokes number is a measure of flow tracer fidelity in particle image velocimetry (PIV) experiments where very small particles are entrained in turbulent flows and optically observed to determine the speed and direction of fluid movement (also known as the velocity field of the fluid). For acceptable tracing accuracy, the particle response time should be faster than the smallest time scale of the flow. Smaller Stokes numbers represent better tracing accuracy; for S t k ≫ 1 {\displaystyle \mathrm {Stk} \gg 1} , particles will detach from a flow especially where the flow decelerates abruptly. For S t k ≪ 1 {\displaystyle \mathrm {Stk} \ll 1} , particles follow fluid streamlines closely. If S t k < 0.1 {\displaystyle \mathrm {Stk} <0.1} , tracing accuracy errors are below 1%. [3] Relaxation time and tracking error in particle image velocimetry (PIV) [ edit ] Comparison between two different particle sizes for tracking accuracy for PIV. Simulated particles (blue dots) of propylene glycol advecting in a stagnation point flow field (gray streamlines). Note that the 1 mm particles crash onto the stagnation plate whereas the 0.1 mm particles follow the streamlines. The Stokes number provides a means of estimating the quality of PIV data sets, as previously discussed. However, a definition of a characteristic velocity or length scale may not be evident in all applications. Thus, a deeper insight of how a tracking delay arises could be drawn by simply defining the differential equations of a particle in the Stokes regime. A particle moving with the fluid at some velocity v p ( t ) {\displaystyle v_{p}(t)} will encounter a variable fluid velocity field as it advects. Let's assume the velocity of the fluid, in the Lagrangian frame of reference of the particle, is v f ( t ) {\displaystyle v_{f}(t)} . It is the difference between these velocities that will generate the drag force necessary to correct the particle path: Δ v ( t ) = v f ( t ) − v p ( t ) {\displaystyle \Delta v(t)=v_{f}(t)-v_{p}(t)} The stokes drag force is then: F D = 3 π μ d p Δ v {\displaystyle F_{D}=3\pi \mu d_{p}\Delta v} The particle mass is: m p = ρ p 4 3 π ( d p 2 ) 3 = ρ p π d p 3 6 {\displaystyle m_{p}=\rho _{p}{\frac {4}{3}}\pi {\bigg (}{\frac {d_{p}}{2}}{\bigg )}^{3}=\rho _{p}{\frac {\pi d_{p}^{3}}{6}}} Thus, the particle acceleration can be found through Newton's second law: d v p ( t ) d t = F D m p = 18 μ d p 2 ρ p Δ v ( t ) {\displaystyle {\frac {dv_{p}(t)}{dt}}={\frac {F_{D}}{m_{p}}}={\frac {18\mu }{{d_{p}}^{2}\rho _{p}}}\Delta v(t)} Note the relaxation time t 0 = ρ p d p 2 18 μ g {\displaystyle t_{0}={\frac {\rho _{p}d_{p}^{2}}{18\mu _{g}}}} can be replaced to yield: d v p ( t ) d t = 1 t 0 Δ v ( t ) {\displaystyle {\frac {dv_{p}(t)}{dt}}={\frac {1}{t_{0}}}\Delta v(t)} The first-order differential equation above can be solved through the Laplace transform method: t 0 s v p ( s ) = v f − v p ( s ) {\displaystyle t_{0}sv_{p}(s)=v_{f}-v_{p}(s)} v p ( s ) v f ( s ) = 1 t 0 s + 1 {\displaystyle {\frac {v_{p}(s)}{v_{f}(s)}}={\frac {1}{t_{0}s+1}}} The solution above, in the frequency domain, characterizes a first-order system with a characteristic time of t 0 {\displaystyle t_{0}} . Thus, the −3 dB gain (cut-off) frequency will be: f − 3 dB = 1 2 π t 0 {\displaystyle f_{-3{\text{ dB}}}={\frac {1}{2\pi t_{0}}}} The cut-off frequency and the particle transfer function, plotted on the side panel, allows for the assessment of PIV error in unsteady flow applications and its effect on turbulence spectral quantities and kinetic energy. Bode plot of a propylene glycol particle in air for different particle diameters. Particles through a shock wave [ edit ] The bias error in particle tracking discussed in the previous section is evident in the frequency domain, but it can be difficult to appreciate in cases where the particle motion is being tracked to perform flow field measurements (like in particle image velocimetry ). A simple but insightful solution to the above-mentioned differential equation is possible when the forcing function v f ( t ) = V u − Δ V H ( t ) {\displaystyle v_{f}(t)=V_{u}-\Delta VH(t)} is a Heaviside step function; representing particles going through a shockwave. In this case, V u {\displaystyle V_{u}} is the flow velocity upstream of the shock; whereas Δ V {\displaystyle \Delta V} is the velocity drop across the shock. The step response for a particle is a simple exponential: v p ( t ) = ( V u − Δ V ) + Δ V e − t / t 0 {\displaystyle v_{p}(t)=(V_{u}-\Delta V)+\Delta Ve^{-t/t_{0}}} To convert the velocity as a function of time to a particle velocity distribution as a function of distance, let's assume a 1-dimensional velocity jump in the x {\displaystyle x} direction. Let's assume x = 0 {\displaystyle x=0} is positioned where the shock wave is, and then integrate the previous equation to get: x particle = ∫ 0 Δ t v p ( t ) d t = ∫ 0 Δ t ( V u − Δ V ) d t + ∫ 0 Δ t Δ V e − t / t 0 d t {\displaystyle x_{\text{particle}}=\int _{0}^{\Delta t}v_{p}(t)dt=\int _{0}^{\Delta t}(V_{u}-\Delta V)dt+\int _{0}^{\Delta t}\Delta Ve^{-t/t_{0}}dt} x particle = Δ t ( V u − Δ V ) + Δ t Δ V ( 1 − e − Δ t / t 0 ) {\displaystyle x_{\text{particle}}=\Delta t(V_{u}-\Delta V)+\Delta t\Delta V(1-e^{-\Delta t/t_{0}})} Considering a relaxation time of Δ t = 3 t 0 {\displaystyle \Delta t=3t_{0}} (time to 95% velocity change), we have: x particle , 95 % = 3 t 0 ( V u − Δ V ) + 3 t 0 Δ V ( 1 − e − 3 ) {\displaystyle x_{{\text{particle}},95\%}=3t_{0}(V_{u}-\Delta V)+3t_{0}\Delta V(1-e^{-3})} x particle , 95 % = 3 t 0 ( V u − 0.05 Δ V ) {\displaystyle x_{{\text{particle}},95\%}=3t_{0}(V_{u}-0.05\Delta V)} This means the particle velocity would be settled to within 5% of the downstream velocity at x particle , 95 % {\displaystyle x_{{\text{particle}},95\%}} from the shock. In practice, this means a shock wave would look, to a PIV system, blurred by approximately this x particle , 95 % {\displaystyle x_{{\text{particle}},95\%}} distance. For example, consider a normal shock wave of Mach number M = 2 {\displaystyle M=2} at a stagnation temperature of 298 K. A propylene glycol particle of d p = 1 μ m {\displaystyle d_{p}=1~\mu {\text{m}}} would blur the flow by x particle , 95 % = 5 mm {\displaystyle x_{{\text{particle}},95\%}=5{\text{ mm}}} ; whereas a d p = 10 μ m {\displaystyle d_{p}=10~\mu {\text{m}}} would blur the flow by x particle , 95 % = 500 mm {\displaystyle x_{{\text{particle}},95\%}=500{\text{ mm}}} (which would, in most cases, yield unacceptable PIV results). Although a shock wave is the worst-case scenario of abrupt deceleration of a flow, it illustrates the effect of particle tracking error in PIV, which results in a blurring of the velocity fields acquired at the length scales of order x particle , 95 % {\displaystyle x_{{\text{particle}},95\%}} . Non-Stokesian drag regime [ edit ] The preceding analysis will not be accurate in the ultra-Stokesian regime. i.e. if the particle Reynolds number is much greater than unity. Assuming a Mach number much less than unity, a generalized form of the Stokes number was demonstrated by Israel & Rosner. [4] Stk e = Stk 24 Re o ∫ 0 Re o d Re ′ C D ( Re ′ ) Re ′ {\displaystyle {\text{Stk}}_{\text{e}}={\text{Stk}}{\frac {24}{{\text{Re}}_{o}}}\int _{0}^{{\text{Re}}_{o}}{\frac {d{\text{Re}}^{\prime }}{C_{D}({\text{Re}}^{\prime }){\text{Re}}^{\prime }}}} Where Re o {\displaystyle {\text{Re}}_{o}} is the ""particle free-stream Reynolds number"", Re o = ρ g | u | d p μ g {\displaystyle {\text{Re}}_{o}={\frac {\rho _{g}|\mathbf {u} |d_{p}}{\mu _{g}}}} An additional function ψ ( Re o ) {\displaystyle \psi ({\text{Re}}_{o})} was defined by; [4] this describes the non-Stokesian drag correction factor, Stk e = Stk ⋅ ψ ( Re o ) {\displaystyle {\text{Stk}}_{e}={\text{Stk}}\cdot \psi ({\text{Re}}_{o})} It follows that this function is defined by, ψ {\displaystyle \psi } describes the non-Stokesian drag correction factor for a spherical particle ψ ( Re o ) = 24 Re o ∫ 0 Re o d Re ′ C D ( Re ′ ) Re ′ {\displaystyle \psi ({\text{Re}}_{o})={\frac {24}{{\text{Re}}_{o}}}\int _{0}^{{\text{Re}}_{o}}{\frac {d{\text{Re}}^{\prime }}{C_{D}({\text{Re}}^{\prime }){\text{Re}}^{\prime }}}} Considering the limiting particle free-stream Reynolds numbers, as Re o → 0 {\displaystyle {\text{Re}}_{o}\to 0} then C D ( Re o ) → 24 / Re o {\displaystyle C_{D}({\text{Re}}_{o})\to 24/{\text{Re}}_{o}} and therefore ψ → 1 {\displaystyle \psi \to 1} . Thus as expected there correction factor is unity in the Stokesian drag regime. Wessel & Righi [5] evaluated ψ {\displaystyle \psi } for C D ( Re ) {\displaystyle C_{D}({\text{Re}})} from the empirical correlation for drag on a sphere from Schiller & Naumann. [6] ψ ( Re o ) = 3 ( c Re o 1 / 3 − arctan ⁡ ( c Re o 1 / 3 ) ) c 3 / 2 Re o {\displaystyle \psi ({\text{Re}}_{o})={\frac {3({\sqrt {c}}{\text{Re}}_{o}^{1/3}-\arctan({\sqrt {c}}{\text{Re}}_{o}^{1/3}))}{c^{3/2}{\text{Re}}_{o}}}} Where the constant c = 0.158 {\displaystyle c=0.158} . The conventional Stokes number will significantly underestimate the drag force for large particle free-stream Reynolds numbers. Thus overestimating the tendency for particles to depart from the fluid flow direction. This will lead to errors in subsequent calculations or experimental comparisons. Application to anisokinetic sampling of particles [ edit ] For example, the selective capture of particles by an aligned, thin-walled circular nozzle is given by Belyaev and Levin [7] as: c / c 0 = 1 + ( u 0 / u − 1 ) ( 1 − 1 1 + S t k ( 2 + 0.617 u / u 0 ) ) {\displaystyle c/c_{0}=1+(u_{0}/u-1)\left(1-{\frac {1}{1+\mathrm {Stk} (2+0.617u/u_{0})}}\right)} where c {\displaystyle c} is particle concentration, u {\displaystyle u} is speed, and the subscript 0 indicates conditions far upstream of the nozzle. The characteristic distance is the diameter of the nozzle. Here the Stokes number is calculated, S t k = u 0 V s d g {\displaystyle \mathrm {Stk} ={\frac {u_{0}V_{s}}{dg}}} where V s {\displaystyle V_{s}} is the particle's settling velocity, d {\displaystyle d} is the sampling tube's inner diameter, and g {\displaystyle g} is the acceleration of gravity.

The specific problem is: The only thing I can understand here is that ""something makes the lines curvy..."" further to this both examples on this page are extremely erroneous. WikiProject Mathematics may be able to help recruit an expert. ( June 2023 ) In complex analysis the Stokes phenomenon , discovered by G. G. Stokes ( 1847 , 1858 ), is where the asymptotic behavior of functions can differ in different regions of the complex plane. This seemingly gives rise to a paradox when looking at the asymptotic expansion of an analytic function. Since an analytic function is continuous you would expect the asymptotic expansion to be continuous. This paradox is the subject of Stokes' early research and is known as Stokes phenomenon. The regions in the complex plane with different asymptotic behaviour are bounded by possibly one or two types of curves known as Stokes curves and Anti-Stokes Curves. This apparent paradox has since been resolved and the supposed discontinuous jump in the asymptotic expansions has been shown to be smooth and continuous. In order to resolve this paradox the asymptotic expansion needs to be handled in a careful manner. More specifically the asymptotic expansion must include additional exponentially small terms relative to the usual algebraic terms included in a usual asymptotic expansion. What happens in Stokes phenomenon is that an asymptotic expansion in one region may contain an exponentially small contribution (neglecting this contribution still gives a correct asymptotic expansion for that region). However, this exponentially small term can become exponentially large in another region of the complex plane, this change occurs across the Anti-Stokes curves. Furthermore the exponentially small term may switch on or off other exponentially small terms, this change occurs across a Stokes curve. Including these exponentially small terms allows the asymptotic expansion to be written as a continuous expansion for the entire complex domain which resolves the Stokes Phenomenon paradox. Stokes Curves and anti-Stokes Curves [ edit ] Across a Stokes curve, an exponentially small term can switch on or off another exponentially small term. Across an anti-Stokes curve, a subdominant exponentially small term can switch to a dominant exponentially large term or vice versa. This change in behaviour across the Stokes and anti-Stokes curves is directly related to the divergence of the asymptotic expansion. The usual type of divergence seen in an asymptotic series that exhibits Stokes phenomenon is known as factorial-over-power divergence and has the typical form ∑ j ∞ ϵ j A Γ ( j + α ) χ j + α , {\displaystyle \sum _{j}^{\infty }\epsilon ^{j}{\frac {A\Gamma (j+\alpha )}{\chi ^{j+\alpha }}},} Where A {\displaystyle A} is a function known as the prefactor, χ {\displaystyle \chi } is a function known as the Singulant and Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } is the gamma function. Stokes curves are determined using the condition ℑ { χ } = 0 {\displaystyle \Im \{\chi \}=0} and ℜ { χ } > 0 {\displaystyle \Re \{\chi \}>0} . Anti Stokes curve are determined by the condition ℜ { χ } = 0 {\displaystyle \Re \{\chi \}=0} . Example: the Airy function [ edit ] The Airy function Ai( x ) is one of two solutions to a simple differential equation y ″ − x y = 0 , {\displaystyle y''-xy=0,\,} which it is often useful to approximate for many values of x – including complex values. For large x of given argument the solution can be approximated by a linear combination of the functions e ± 2 3 x 3 / 2 x 1 / 4 . {\displaystyle {\frac {e^{\pm {\frac {2}{3}}x^{3/2}}}{x^{1/4}}}.} However, the linear combination has to change as the argument of x passes certain values (when x crosses a branch cut ) because these approximations contain multi-valued functions. In contrast, the Airy function is single valued and indeed entire and therefore, in order to make sense of the approximation, one has to choose a single value out of the multiple possible values (this imposes a branch cut for the approximation, by implication). For example, if we regard the limit of x as large and real, and would like to approximate the Airy function for both positive and negative values, we would find that Plot of Ai( x ) in red and Bi( x ) in blue A i ( x ) ∼ e − 2 3 x 3 / 2 2 π x 1 / 4 A i ( − x ) ∼ sin ⁡ ( 2 3 x 3 / 2 + 1 4 π ) π x 1 / 4 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathrm {Ai} (x)&{}\sim {\frac {e^{-{\frac {2}{3}}x^{3/2}}}{2{\sqrt {\pi }}\,x^{1/4}}}\\\mathrm {Ai} (-x)&{}\sim {\frac {\sin({\frac {2}{3}}x^{3/2}+{\frac {1}{4}}\pi )}{{\sqrt {\pi }}\,x^{1/4}}}\\\end{aligned}}} Stokes lines and anti-Stokes lines for the Airy function which are two very different expressions. What has happened is that as we have increased the argument of x from 0 to pi (rotating it around through the upper half complex plane) we have crossed an anti-Stokes line, which in this case is at arg x = π / 3 {\displaystyle \operatorname {arg} \,x=\pi /3} . At this anti-Stokes line, the coefficient of e − 2 3 x 3 / 2 x 1 / 4 {\displaystyle {\frac {e^{-{\frac {2}{3}}x^{3/2}}}{x^{1/4}}}} is forced to jump. The coefficient of e + 2 3 x 3 / 2 x 1 / 4 {\displaystyle {\frac {e^{+{\frac {2}{3}}x^{3/2}}}{x^{1/4}}}} can jump at this line but is not forced to; it can change gradually as arg x varies from π/3 to π because it is not determined in this region. There are three anti-Stokes lines with arguments π/3, π. –π/3, and three Stokes lines with arguments 2π/3, 0. –2π/3. Example: second order linear differential equations [ edit ] The Airy function example can be generalized to a broad class of second order linear differential equations as follows. By standard changes of variables, a second order equation can often be changed to one of the form d 2 w d z 2 = f ( z ) w {\displaystyle {\frac {d^{2}w}{dz^{2}}}=f(z)w} where f is holomorphic in a simply-connected region and w is a solution of the differential equation. Then in some cases the WKB method gives an asymptotic approximation for w as a linear combination of functions of the form e ± ∫ a z f ( z ′ ) d z ′ f ( z ) 1 / 4 {\displaystyle {\frac {e^{\pm \int _{a}^{z}{\sqrt {f(z')}}\,dz'}}{f(z)^{1/4}}}} for some constant a . (Choosing different values of a is equivalent to choosing different coefficients in the linear combination.) The anti-Stokes lines and Stokes lines are then the zeros of the real and imaginary parts, respectively, of ∫ a z f ( z ′ ) d z ′ . {\displaystyle \int _{a}^{z}{\sqrt {f(z')}}\,dz'.} If a is a simple zero of f then locally f looks like f ′ ( a ) ( z − a ) {\displaystyle f'(a)(z-a)} . Solutions will locally behave like the Airy functions; they will have three Stokes lines and three anti-Stokes lines meeting at a .

They were defined by George Gabriel Stokes in 1852, [1] [2] as a mathematically convenient alternative to the more common description of incoherent or partially polarized radiation in terms of its total intensity ( I ), (fractional) degree of polarization ( p ), and the shape parameters of the polarization ellipse . The effect of an optical system on the polarization of light can be determined by constructing the Stokes vector for the input light and applying Mueller calculus , to obtain the Stokes vector of the light leaving the system. They can be determined from directly observable phenomena. The original Stokes paper was discovered independently by Francis Perrin in 1942 [3] and by Subrahamanyan Chandrasekhar in 1947, [4] [5] who named it as the Stokes parameters. Definitions [ edit ] Polarisation ellipse, showing the relationship to the Poincaré sphere parameters ψ and χ. The Poincaré sphere is the parametrisation of the last three Stokes' parameters in spherical coordinates . Depiction of the polarization states on Poincaré sphere The relationship of the Stokes parameters S 0 , S 1 , S 2 , S 3 to intensity and polarization ellipse parameters is shown in the equations below and the figure on the right. S 0 = I S 1 = I p cos ⁡ 2 ψ cos ⁡ 2 χ S 2 = I p sin ⁡ 2 ψ cos ⁡ 2 χ S 3 = I p sin ⁡ 2 χ {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}S_{0}&=I\\S_{1}&=Ip\cos 2\psi \cos 2\chi \\S_{2}&=Ip\sin 2\psi \cos 2\chi \\S_{3}&=Ip\sin 2\chi \end{aligned}}} Here I p {\displaystyle Ip} , 2 ψ {\displaystyle 2\psi } and 2 χ {\displaystyle 2\chi } are the spherical coordinates of the three-dimensional vector of cartesian coordinates ( S 1 , S 2 , S 3 ) {\displaystyle (S_{1},S_{2},S_{3})} . I {\displaystyle I} is the total intensity of the beam, and p {\displaystyle p} is the degree of polarization, constrained by 0 ≤ p ≤ 1 {\displaystyle 0\leq p\leq 1} . The factor of two before ψ {\displaystyle \psi } represents the fact that any polarization ellipse is indistinguishable from one rotated by 180°, while the factor of two before χ {\displaystyle \chi } indicates that an ellipse is indistinguishable from one with the semi-axis lengths swapped accompanied by a 90° rotation. The phase information of the polarized light is not recorded in the Stokes parameters. The four Stokes parameters are sometimes denoted I , Q , U and V , respectively. Given the Stokes parameters, one can solve for the spherical coordinates with the following equations: I = S 0 p = S 1 2 + S 2 2 + S 3 2 S 0 2 ψ = a r c t a n S 2 S 1 2 χ = a r c t a n S 3 S 1 2 + S 2 2 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}I&=S_{0}\\p&={\frac {\sqrt {S_{1}^{2}+S_{2}^{2}+S_{3}^{2}}}{S_{0}}}\\2\psi &=\mathrm {arctan} {\frac {S_{2}}{S_{1}}}\\2\chi &=\mathrm {arctan} {\frac {S_{3}}{\sqrt {S_{1}^{2}+S_{2}^{2}}}}\\\end{aligned}}} Stokes vectors [ edit ] The Stokes parameters are often combined into a vector, known as the Stokes vector : S → = ( S 0 S 1 S 2 S 3 ) = ( I Q U V ) {\displaystyle {\vec {S}}\ ={\begin{pmatrix}S_{0}\\S_{1}\\S_{2}\\S_{3}\end{pmatrix}}={\begin{pmatrix}I\\Q\\U\\V\end{pmatrix}}} The Stokes vector spans the space of unpolarized, partially polarized, and fully polarized light. For comparison, the Jones vector only spans the space of fully polarized light, but is more useful for problems involving coherent light. The four Stokes parameters are not a preferred coordinate system of the space, but rather were chosen because they can be easily measured or calculated. Note that there is an ambiguous sign for the V {\displaystyle V} component depending on the physical convention used. In practice, there are two separate conventions used, either defining the Stokes parameters when looking down the beam towards the source (opposite the direction of light propagation) or looking down the beam away from the source (coincident with the direction of light propagation). These two conventions result in different signs for V {\displaystyle V} , and a convention must be chosen and adhered to. Examples [ edit ] Below are shown some Stokes vectors for common states of polarization of light. ( 1 1 0 0 ) {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1\\1\\0\\0\end{pmatrix}}} Linearly polarized (horizontal) ( 1 − 1 0 0 ) {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1\\-1\\0\\0\end{pmatrix}}} Linearly polarized (vertical) ( 1 0 1 0 ) {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1\\0\\1\\0\end{pmatrix}}} Linearly polarized (+45°) ( 1 0 − 1 0 ) {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1\\0\\-1\\0\end{pmatrix}}} Linearly polarized (−45°) ( 1 0 0 1 ) {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1\\0\\0\\1\end{pmatrix}}} Right-hand circularly polarized ( 1 0 0 − 1 ) {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1\\0\\0\\-1\end{pmatrix}}} Left-hand circularly polarized ( 1 0 0 0 ) {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1\\0\\0\\0\end{pmatrix}}} Unpolarized Alternative explanation [ edit ] A monochromatic plane wave is specified by its propagation vector , k → {\displaystyle {\vec {k}}} , and the complex amplitudes of the electric field , E 1 {\displaystyle E_{1}} and E 2 {\displaystyle E_{2}} , in a basis ( ϵ ^ 1 , ϵ ^ 2 ) {\displaystyle ({\hat {\epsilon }}_{1},{\hat {\epsilon }}_{2})} . The pair ( E 1 , E 2 ) {\displaystyle (E_{1},E_{2})} is called a Jones vector . Alternatively, one may specify the propagation vector, the phase , ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } , and the polarization state, Ψ {\displaystyle \Psi } , where Ψ {\displaystyle \Psi } is the curve traced out by the electric field as a function of time in a fixed plane. The most familiar polarization states are linear and circular, which are degenerate cases of the most general state, an ellipse . One way to describe polarization is by giving the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the polarization ellipse, its orientation, and the direction of rotation (See the above figure). The Stokes parameters I {\displaystyle I} , Q {\displaystyle Q} , U {\displaystyle U} , and V {\displaystyle V} , provide an alternative description of the polarization state which is experimentally convenient because each parameter corresponds to a sum or difference of measurable intensities. The next figure shows examples of the Stokes parameters in degenerate states. Definitions [ edit ] The Stokes parameters are defined by [ citation needed ] I ≡ ⟨ E x 2 ⟩ + ⟨ E y 2 ⟩ = ⟨ E a 2 ⟩ + ⟨ E b 2 ⟩ = ⟨ E r 2 ⟩ + ⟨ E l 2 ⟩ , Q ≡ ⟨ E x 2 ⟩ − ⟨ E y 2 ⟩ , U ≡ ⟨ E a 2 ⟩ − ⟨ E b 2 ⟩ , V ≡ ⟨ E r 2 ⟩ − ⟨ E l 2 ⟩ . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}I&\equiv \langle E_{x}^{2}\rangle +\langle E_{y}^{2}\rangle \\&=\langle E_{a}^{2}\rangle +\langle E_{b}^{2}\rangle \\&=\langle E_{r}^{2}\rangle +\langle E_{l}^{2}\rangle ,\\Q&\equiv \langle E_{x}^{2}\rangle -\langle E_{y}^{2}\rangle ,\\U&\equiv \langle E_{a}^{2}\rangle -\langle E_{b}^{2}\rangle ,\\V&\equiv \langle E_{r}^{2}\rangle -\langle E_{l}^{2}\rangle .\end{aligned}}} where the subscripts refer to three different bases of the space of Jones vectors : the standard Cartesian basis ( x ^ , y ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {x}},{\hat {y}}} ), a Cartesian basis rotated by 45° ( a ^ , b ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {a}},{\hat {b}}} ), and a circular basis ( l ^ , r ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {l}},{\hat {r}}} ). The circular basis is defined so that l ^ = ( x ^ + i y ^ ) / 2 {\displaystyle {\hat {l}}=({\hat {x}}+i{\hat {y}})/{\sqrt {2}}} , r ^ = ( x ^ − i y ^ ) / 2 {\displaystyle {\hat {r}}=({\hat {x}}-i{\hat {y}})/{\sqrt {2}}} . The symbols ⟨⋅⟩ represent expectation values . The light can be viewed as a random variable taking values in the space C 2 of Jones vectors ( E 1 , E 2 ) {\displaystyle (E_{1},E_{2})} . Any given measurement yields a specific wave (with a specific phase, polarization ellipse, and magnitude), but it keeps flickering and wobbling between different outcomes. The expectation values are various averages of these outcomes. Intense, but unpolarized light will have I > 0 but Q = U = V = 0, reflecting that no polarization type predominates. A convincing waveform is depicted at the article on coherence . The opposite would be perfectly polarized light which, in addition, has a fixed, nonvarying amplitude—a pure sine curve. This is represented by a random variable with only a single possible value, say ( E 1 , E 2 ) {\displaystyle (E_{1},E_{2})} . In this case one may replace the brackets by absolute value bars, obtaining a well-defined quadratic map [ citation needed ] I ≡ | E x | 2 + | E y | 2 = | E a | 2 + | E b | 2 = | E r | 2 + | E l | 2 Q ≡ | E x | 2 − | E y | 2 , U ≡ | E a | 2 − | E b | 2 , V ≡ | E r | 2 − | E l | 2 . {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}I\equiv |E_{x}|^{2}+|E_{y}|^{2}=|E_{a}|^{2}+|E_{b}|^{2}=|E_{r}|^{2}+|E_{l}|^{2}\\Q\equiv |E_{x}|^{2}-|E_{y}|^{2},\\U\equiv |E_{a}|^{2}-|E_{b}|^{2},\\V\equiv |E_{r}|^{2}-|E_{l}|^{2}.\end{matrix}}} from the Jones vectors to the corresponding Stokes vectors; more convenient forms are given below. The map takes its image in the cone defined by | I | 2 = | Q | 2 + | U | 2 + | V | 2 , where the purity of the state satisfies p = 1 (see below). The next figure shows how the signs of the Stokes parameters are determined by the helicity and the orientation of the semi-major axis of the polarization ellipse. Representations in fixed bases [ edit ] In a fixed ( x ^ , y ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {x}},{\hat {y}}} ) basis, the Stokes parameters when using an increasing phase convention are I = | E x | 2 + | E y | 2 , Q = | E x | 2 − | E y | 2 , U = 2 R e ( E x E y ∗ ) , V = − 2 I m ( E x E y ∗ ) , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}I&=|E_{x}|^{2}+|E_{y}|^{2},\\Q&=|E_{x}|^{2}-|E_{y}|^{2},\\U&=2\mathrm {Re} (E_{x}E_{y}^{*}),\\V&=-2\mathrm {Im} (E_{x}E_{y}^{*}),\\\end{aligned}}} while for ( a ^ , b ^ ) {\displaystyle ({\hat {a}},{\hat {b}})} , they are I = | E a | 2 + | E b | 2 , Q = − 2 R e ( E a ∗ E b ) , U = | E a | 2 − | E b | 2 , V = 2 I m ( E a ∗ E b ) . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}I&=|E_{a}|^{2}+|E_{b}|^{2},\\Q&=-2\mathrm {Re} (E_{a}^{*}E_{b}),\\U&=|E_{a}|^{2}-|E_{b}|^{2},\\V&=2\mathrm {Im} (E_{a}^{*}E_{b}).\\\end{aligned}}} and for ( l ^ , r ^ ) {\displaystyle ({\hat {l}},{\hat {r}})} , they are I = | E l | 2 + | E r | 2 , Q = 2 R e ( E l ∗ E r ) , U = − 2 I m ( E l ∗ E r ) , V = | E r | 2 − | E l | 2 . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}I&=|E_{l}|^{2}+|E_{r}|^{2},\\Q&=2\mathrm {Re} (E_{l}^{*}E_{r}),\\U&=-2\mathrm {Im} (E_{l}^{*}E_{r}),\\V&=|E_{r}|^{2}-|E_{l}|^{2}.\\\end{aligned}}} Properties [ edit ] For purely monochromatic coherent radiation, it follows from the above equations that Q 2 + U 2 + V 2 = I 2 , {\displaystyle Q^{2}+U^{2}+V^{2}=I^{2},} whereas for the whole (non-coherent) beam radiation, the Stokes parameters are defined as averaged quantities, and the previous equation becomes an inequality: [6] Q 2 + U 2 + V 2 ≤ I 2 . {\displaystyle Q^{2}+U^{2}+V^{2}\leq I^{2}.} However, we can define a total polarization intensity I p {\displaystyle I_{p}} , so that Q 2 + U 2 + V 2 = I p 2 , {\displaystyle Q^{2}+U^{2}+V^{2}=I_{p}^{2},} where I p / I {\displaystyle I_{p}/I} is the total polarization fraction. Let us define the complex intensity of linear polarization to be L ≡ | L | e i 2 θ ≡ Q + i U . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}L&\equiv |L|e^{i2\theta }\\&\equiv Q+iU.\\\end{aligned}}} Under a rotation θ → θ + θ ′ {\displaystyle \theta \rightarrow \theta +\theta '} of the polarization ellipse, it can be shown that I {\displaystyle I} and V {\displaystyle V} are invariant, but L → e i 2 θ ′ L , Q → Re ( e i 2 θ ′ L ) , U → Im ( e i 2 θ ′ L ) . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}L&\rightarrow e^{i2\theta '}L,\\Q&\rightarrow {\mbox{Re}}\left(e^{i2\theta '}L\right),\\U&\rightarrow {\mbox{Im}}\left(e^{i2\theta '}L\right).\\\end{aligned}}} With these properties, the Stokes parameters may be thought of as constituting three generalized intensities: I ≥ 0 , V ∈ R , L ∈ C , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}I&\geq 0,\\V&\in \mathbb {R} ,\\L&\in \mathbb {C} ,\\\end{aligned}}} where I {\displaystyle I} is the total intensity, | V | {\displaystyle |V|} is the intensity of circular polarization, and | L | {\displaystyle |L|} is the intensity of linear polarization. The total intensity of polarization is I p = | L | 2 + | V | 2 {\displaystyle I_{p}={\sqrt {|L|^{2}+|V|^{2}}}} , and the orientation and sense of rotation are given by θ = 1 2 arg ⁡ ( L ) , h = sgn ⁡ ( V ) . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\theta &={\frac {1}{2}}\arg(L),\\h&=\operatorname {sgn}(V).\\\end{aligned}}} Since Q = Re ( L ) {\displaystyle Q={\mbox{Re}}(L)} and U = Im ( L ) {\displaystyle U={\mbox{Im}}(L)} , we have | L | = Q 2 + U 2 , θ = 1 2 tan − 1 ⁡ ( U / Q ) . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}|L|&={\sqrt {Q^{2}+U^{2}}},\\\theta &={\frac {1}{2}}\tan ^{-1}(U/Q).\\\end{aligned}}} Relation to the polarization ellipse [ edit ] In terms of the parameters of the polarization ellipse, the Stokes parameters are I p = A 2 + B 2 , Q = ( A 2 − B 2 ) cos ⁡ ( 2 θ ) , U = ( A 2 − B 2 ) sin ⁡ ( 2 θ ) , V = 2 A B h . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}I_{p}&=A^{2}+B^{2},\\Q&=(A^{2}-B^{2})\cos(2\theta ),\\U&=(A^{2}-B^{2})\sin(2\theta ),\\V&=2ABh.\\\end{aligned}}} Inverting the previous equation gives A = 1 2 ( I p + | L | ) B = 1 2 ( I p − | L | ) θ = 1 2 arg ⁡ ( L ) h = sgn ⁡ ( V ) . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}A&={\sqrt {{\frac {1}{2}}(I_{p}+|L|)}}\\B&={\sqrt {{\frac {1}{2}}(I_{p}-|L|)}}\\\theta &={\frac {1}{2}}\arg(L)\\h&=\operatorname {sgn}(V).\\\end{aligned}}} Measurement [ edit ] The Stokes parameters (and thus the polarization of some electromagnetic radiation) can be directly determined from observation. [7] Using a linear polarizer and a quarter-wave plate , the following system of equations relating the Stokes parameters to measured intensity can be obtained: [8] I l ( 0 ) = 1 2 ( I + Q ) I l ( π 4 ) = 1 2 ( I + U ) I l ( π 2 ) = 1 2 ( I − Q ) I q ( π 4 ) = 1 2 ( I + V ) , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}I_{l}(0)&={\frac {1}{2}}(I+Q)\\I_{l}({\frac {\pi }{4}})&={\frac {1}{2}}(I+U)\\I_{l}({\frac {\pi }{2}})&={\frac {1}{2}}(I-Q)\\I_{q}({\frac {\pi }{4}})&={\frac {1}{2}}(I+V),\\\end{aligned}}} where I l ( θ ) {\displaystyle I_{l}(\theta )} is the irradiance of the radiation at a point when the linear polarizer is rotated at an angle of θ {\displaystyle \theta } , and similarly I q ( θ ) {\displaystyle I_{q}(\theta )} is the irradiance at a point when the quarter-wave plate is rotated at an angle of θ {\displaystyle \theta } . A system can be implemented using both plates at once at different angles to measure the parameters. This can give a more accurate measure of the relative magnitudes of the parameters (which is often the main result desired) due to all parameters being affected by the same losses. Relationship to Hermitian operators and quantum mixed states [ edit ] From a geometric and algebraic point of view, the Stokes parameters stand in one-to-one correspondence with the closed, convex, 4-real-dimensional cone of nonnegative Hermitian operators on the Hilbert space C 2 . The parameter I serves as the trace of the operator, whereas the entries of the matrix of the operator are simple linear functions of the four parameters I , Q , U , V , serving as coefficients in a linear combination of the Stokes operators . The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator can be calculated from the polarization ellipse parameters I , p , ψ , χ . The Stokes parameters with I set equal to 1 (i.e. the trace 1 operators) are in one-to-one correspondence with the closed unit 3-dimensional ball of mixed states (or density operators ) of the quantum space C 2 , whose boundary is the Bloch sphere . The Jones vectors correspond to the underlying space C 2 , that is, the (unnormalized) pure states of the same system. Note that the overall phase (i.e. the common phase factor between the two component waves on the two perpendicular polarization axes) is lost when passing from a pure state |φ⟩ to the corresponding mixed state |φ⟩⟨φ|, just as it is lost when passing from a Jones vector to the corresponding Stokes vector. In the basis of horizontal polarization state | H ⟩ {\displaystyle |H\rangle } and vertical polarization state | V ⟩ {\displaystyle |V\rangle } , the +45° linear polarization state is | + ⟩ = 1 2 ( | H ⟩ + | V ⟩ ) {\displaystyle |+\rangle ={\frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}}(|H\rangle +|V\rangle )} , the -45° linear polarization state is | − ⟩ = 1 2 ( | H ⟩ − | V ⟩ ) {\displaystyle |-\rangle ={\frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}}(|H\rangle -|V\rangle )} , the left hand circular polarization state is | L ⟩ = 1 2 ( | H ⟩ + i | V ⟩ ) {\displaystyle |L\rangle ={\frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}}(|H\rangle +i|V\rangle )} , and the right hand circular polarization state is | R ⟩ = 1 2 ( | H ⟩ − i | V ⟩ ) {\displaystyle |R\rangle ={\frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}}(|H\rangle -i|V\rangle )} . It's easy to see that these states are the eigenvectors of Pauli matrices , and that the normalized Stokes parameters ( U/I , V/I , Q/I ) correspond to the coordinates of the Bloch vector ( a x {\displaystyle a_{x}} , a y {\displaystyle a_{y}} , a z {\displaystyle a_{z}} ). Equivalently, we have U / I = t r ( ρ σ x ) {\displaystyle U/I=tr\left(\rho \sigma _{x}\right)} , V / I = t r ( ρ σ y ) {\displaystyle V/I=tr\left(\rho \sigma _{y}\right)} , Q / I = t r ( ρ σ z ) {\displaystyle Q/I=tr\left(\rho \sigma _{z}\right)} , where ρ {\displaystyle \rho } is the density matrix of the mixed state. Generally, a linear polarization at angle θ has a pure quantum state | θ ⟩ = cos ⁡ θ | H ⟩ + sin ⁡ θ | V ⟩ {\displaystyle |\theta \rangle =\cos {\theta }|H\rangle +\sin {\theta }|V\rangle } ; therefore, the transmittance of a linear polarizer/analyzer at angle θ for a mixed state light source with density matrix ρ = 1 2 ( I + a x σ x + a y σ y + a z σ z ) {\displaystyle \rho ={\frac {1}{2}}\left(I+a_{x}\sigma _{x}+a_{y}\sigma _{y}+a_{z}\sigma _{z}\right)} is t r ( ρ | θ ⟩ ⟨ θ | ) = 1 2 ( 1 + a x sin ⁡ 2 θ + a z cos ⁡ 2 θ ) {\displaystyle tr(\rho |\theta \rangle \langle \theta |)={\frac {1}{2}}\left(1+a_{x}\sin {2\theta }+a_{z}\cos {2\theta }\right)} , with a maximum transmittance of 1 2 ( 1 + a x 2 + a z 2 ) {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}(1+{\sqrt {a_{x}^{2}+a_{z}^{2}}})} at θ 0 = 1 2 arctan ⁡ ( a x / a z ) {\displaystyle \theta _{0}={\frac {1}{2}}\arctan {(a_{x}/a_{z})}} if a z > 0 {\displaystyle a_{z}>0} , or at θ 0 = 1 2 arctan ⁡ ( a x / a z ) + π 2 {\displaystyle \theta _{0}={\frac {1}{2}}\arctan {(a_{x}/a_{z})}+{\frac {\pi }{2}}} if a z < 0 {\displaystyle a_{z}<0} ; the minimum transmittance of 1 2 ( 1 − a x 2 + a z 2 ) {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}(1-{\sqrt {a_{x}^{2}+a_{z}^{2}}})} is reached at the perpendicular to the maximum transmittance direction. Here, the ratio of maximum transmittance to minimum transmittance is defined as the extinction ratio E R = ( 1 + D O L P ) / ( 1 − D O L P ) {\displaystyle ER=(1+DOLP)/(1-DOLP)} , where the degree of linear polarization is D O L P = a x 2 + a z 2 {\displaystyle DOLP={\sqrt {a_{x}^{2}+a_{z}^{2}}}} . Equivalently, the formula for the transmittance can be rewritten as A cos 2 ⁡ ( θ − θ 0 ) + B {\displaystyle A\cos ^{2}{(\theta -\theta _{0})}+B} , which is an extended form of Malus's law ; here, A , B {\displaystyle A,B} are both non-negative, and is related to the extinction ratio by E R = ( A + B ) / B {\displaystyle ER=(A+B)/B} . Two of the normalized Stokes parameters can also be calculated by a x = D O L P sin ⁡ 2 θ 0 , a z = D O L P cos ⁡ 2 θ 0 , D O L P = ( E R − 1 ) / ( E R + 1 ) {\displaystyle a_{x}=DOLP\sin {2\theta _{0}},\,a_{z}=DOLP\cos {2\theta _{0}},\,DOLP=(ER-1)/(ER+1)} . It's also worth noting that a rotation of polarization axis by angle θ corresponds to the Bloch sphere rotation operator R y ( 2 θ ) = [ cos ⁡ θ − sin ⁡ θ sin ⁡ θ cos ⁡ θ ] {\displaystyle R_{y}(2\theta )={\begin{bmatrix}\cos \theta &-\sin \theta \\\sin \theta &\cos \theta \end{bmatrix}}} . For example, the horizontal polarization state | H ⟩ {\displaystyle |H\rangle } would rotate to | θ ⟩ = cos ⁡ θ | H ⟩ + sin ⁡ θ | V ⟩ {\displaystyle |\theta \rangle =\cos {\theta }|H\rangle +\sin {\theta }|V\rangle } . The effect of a quarter-wave plate aligned to the horizontal axis is described by R z ( π / 2 ) = [ e − i π / 4 0 0 e + i π / 4 ] {\displaystyle R_{z}(\pi /2)={\begin{bmatrix}e^{-i\pi /4}&0\\0&e^{+i\pi /4}\end{bmatrix}}} , or equivalently the Phase gate S , and the resulting Bloch vector becomes ( − a y , a x , a z ) {\displaystyle (-a_{y},a_{x},a_{z})} . With this configuration, if we perform the rotating analyzer method to measure the extinction ratio, we will be able to calculate a y {\displaystyle a_{y}} and also verify a z {\displaystyle a_{z}} . For this method to work, the fast axis and the slow axis of the waveplate must be aligned with the reference directions for the basis states. The effect of a quarter-wave plate rotated by angle θ can be determined by Rodrigues' rotation formula as R n ( π / 2 ) = 1 2 I − i 1 2 ( n ^ ⋅ σ → ) {\displaystyle R_{n}(\pi /2)={\frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}}I-i{\frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}}({\hat {n}}\cdot {\vec {\sigma }})} , with n ^ = z ^ cos ⁡ 2 θ + x ^ sin ⁡ 2 θ {\displaystyle {\hat {n}}={\hat {z}}\cos {2\theta }+{\hat {x}}\sin {2\theta }} . The transmittance of the resulting light through a linear polarizer (analyzer plate) along the horizontal axis can be calculated using the same Rodrigues' rotation formula and focusing on its components on I {\displaystyle I} and σ z {\displaystyle \sigma _{z}} : T = t r [ R n ( π / 2 ) ρ R n ( − π / 2 ) | H ⟩ ⟨ H | ] = 1 2 [ 1 + a y sin ⁡ 2 θ + ( n ^ ⋅ a → ) cos ⁡ 2 θ ] = 1 2 [ 1 + a y sin ⁡ 2 θ + ( a x sin ⁡ 2 θ + a z cos ⁡ 2 θ ) cos ⁡ 2 θ ] = 1 2 ( 1 + a y sin ⁡ 2 θ + D O L P × cos ⁡ ( 4 θ − 2 θ 0 ) + cos ⁡ ( 2 θ 0 ) 2 ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}T&=tr[R_{n}(\pi /2)\rho R_{n}(-\pi /2)|H\rangle \langle H|]\\&={\frac {1}{2}}\left[1+a_{y}\sin {2\theta }+({\hat {n}}\cdot {\vec {a}})\cos {2\theta }\right]\\&={\frac {1}{2}}\left[1+a_{y}\sin {2\theta }+(a_{x}\sin {2\theta }+a_{z}\cos {2\theta })\cos {2\theta }\right]\\&={\frac {1}{2}}\left(1+a_{y}\sin {2\theta }+DOLP\times {\frac {\cos {(4\theta -2\theta _{0})}+\cos {(2\theta _{0})}}{2}}\right)\end{aligned}}} The above expression is the theory basis of many polarimeters. For unpolarized light , T=1/2 is a constant. For purely circularly polarized light, T has a sinusoidal dependence on angle θ with a period of 180 degrees, and can reach absolute extinction where T=0. For purely linearly polarized light, T has a sinusoidal dependence on angle θ with a period of 90 degrees, and absolute extinction is only reachable when the original light's polarization is at 90 degrees from the polarizer (i.e. a z = − 1 {\displaystyle a_{z}=-1} ). In this configuration, θ 0 = π 2 {\displaystyle \theta _{0}={\frac {\pi }{2}}} and T = 1 − cos ⁡ ( 4 θ ) 4 {\displaystyle T={\frac {1-\cos {(4\theta )}}{4}}} , with a maximum of 1/2 at θ=45°, and an extinction point at θ=0°. This result can be used to precisely determine the fast or slow axis of a quarter-wave plate, for example, by using a polarizing beam splitter to obtain a linearly polarized light aligned to the analyzer plate and rotating the quarter-wave plate in between. Similarly, the effect of a half-wave plate rotated by angle θ is described by R n ( π ) = − i ( n ^ ⋅ σ → ) {\displaystyle R_{n}(\pi )=-i({\hat {n}}\cdot {\vec {\sigma }})} , which transforms the density matrix to: R n ( π ) ρ R n ( − π ) = 1 2 ( I + a → ⋅ [ − σ → + 2 n ^ ( n ^ ⋅ σ → ) ] ) = 1 2 [ I − a → ⋅ σ → + 2 ( n ^ ⋅ a → ) ( n ^ ⋅ σ → ) ] {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}R_{n}(\pi )\rho R_{n}(-\pi )&={\frac {1}{2}}\left(I+{\vec {a}}\cdot [-{\vec {\sigma }}+2{\hat {n}}({\hat {n}}\cdot {\vec {\sigma }})]\right)\\&={\frac {1}{2}}\left[I-{\vec {a}}\cdot {\vec {\sigma }}+2({\hat {n}}\cdot {\vec {a}})({\hat {n}}\cdot {\vec {\sigma }})\right]\end{aligned}}} The above expression demonstrates that if the original light is of pure linear polarization (i.e. a y = 0 {\displaystyle a_{y}=0} ), the resulting light after the half-wave plate is still of pure linear polariztion (i.e. without σ y {\displaystyle \sigma _{y}} component) with a rotated major axis. Such rotation of the linear polarization has a sinusoidal dependence on angle θ with a period of 90 degrees.

In particular, the fundamental theorem of calculus is the special case where the manifold is a line segment , Green’s theorem and Stokes' theorem are the cases of a surface in R 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}} or R 3 , {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3},} and the divergence theorem is the case of a volume in R 3 . {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}.} [2] Hence, the theorem is sometimes referred to as the Fundamental Theorem of Multivariate Calculus . [3] Stokes' theorem says that the integral of a differential form ω {\displaystyle \omega } over the boundary ∂ Ω {\displaystyle \partial \Omega } of some orientable manifold Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } is equal to the integral of its exterior derivative d ω {\displaystyle d\omega } over the whole of Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } , i.e., ∫ ∂ Ω ω = ∫ Ω d ⁡ ω . {\displaystyle \int _{\partial \Omega }\omega =\int _{\Omega }\operatorname {d} \omega \,.} Stokes' theorem was formulated in its modern form by Élie Cartan in 1945, [4] following earlier work on the generalization of the theorems of vector calculus by Vito Volterra , Édouard Goursat , and Henri Poincaré . [5] [6] This modern form of Stokes' theorem is a vast generalization of a classical result that Lord Kelvin communicated to George Stokes in a letter dated July 2, 1850. [7] [8] [9] Stokes set the theorem as a question on the 1854 Smith's Prize exam, which led to the result bearing his name. It was first published by Hermann Hankel in 1861. [9] [10] This classical case relates the surface integral of the curl of a vector field F {\displaystyle {\textbf {F}}} over a surface (that is, the flux of curl F {\displaystyle {\text{curl}}\,{\textbf {F}}} ) in Euclidean three-space to the line integral of the vector field over the surface boundary. Introduction [ edit ] The second fundamental theorem of calculus states that the integral of a function f {\displaystyle f} over the interval [ a , b ] {\displaystyle [a,b]} can be calculated by finding an antiderivative F {\displaystyle F} of f {\displaystyle f} : ∫ a b f ( x ) d x = F ( b ) − F ( a ) . {\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx=F(b)-F(a)\,.} Stokes' theorem is a vast generalization of this theorem in the following sense. By the choice of F {\displaystyle F} , d F d x = f ( x ) {\displaystyle {\frac {dF}{dx}}=f(x)} . In the parlance of differential forms , this is saying that f ( x ) d x {\displaystyle f(x)\,dx} is the exterior derivative of the 0-form, i.e. function, F {\displaystyle F} : in other words, that d F = f d x {\displaystyle dF=f\,dx} . The general Stokes theorem applies to higher degree differential forms ω {\displaystyle \omega } instead of just 0-forms such as F {\displaystyle F} . A closed interval [ a , b ] {\displaystyle [a,b]} is a simple example of a one-dimensional manifold with boundary . Its boundary is the set consisting of the two points a {\displaystyle a} and b {\displaystyle b} . Integrating f {\displaystyle f} over the interval may be generalized to integrating forms on a higher-dimensional manifold. Two technical conditions are needed: the manifold has to be orientable , and the form has to be compactly supported in order to give a well-defined integral. The two points a {\displaystyle a} and b {\displaystyle b} form the boundary of the closed interval. More generally, Stokes' theorem applies to oriented manifolds M {\displaystyle M} with boundary. The boundary ∂ M {\displaystyle \partial M} of M {\displaystyle M} is itself a manifold and inherits a natural orientation from that of M {\displaystyle M} . For example, the natural orientation of the interval gives an orientation of the two boundary points. Intuitively, a {\displaystyle a} inherits the opposite orientation as b {\displaystyle b} , as they are at opposite ends of the interval. So, ""integrating"" F {\displaystyle F} over two boundary points a {\displaystyle a} , b {\displaystyle b} is taking the difference F ( b ) − F ( a ) {\displaystyle F(b)-F(a)} . In even simpler terms, one can consider the points as boundaries of curves, that is as 0-dimensional boundaries of 1-dimensional manifolds. So, just as one can find the value of an integral ( f d x = d F {\displaystyle f\,dx=dF} ) over a 1-dimensional manifold ( [ a , b ] {\displaystyle [a,b]} ) by considering the anti-derivative ( F {\displaystyle F} ) at the 0-dimensional boundaries ( { a , b } {\displaystyle \{a,b\}} ), one can generalize the fundamental theorem of calculus, with a few additional caveats, to deal with the value of integrals ( d ω {\displaystyle d\omega } ) over n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional manifolds ( Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } ) by considering the antiderivative ( ω {\displaystyle \omega } ) at the ( n − 1 ) {\displaystyle (n-1)} -dimensional boundaries ( ∂ Ω {\displaystyle \partial \Omega } ) of the manifold. So the fundamental theorem reads: ∫ [ a , b ] f ( x ) d x = ∫ [ a , b ] d F = ∫ ∂ [ a , b ] F = ∫ { a } − ∪ { b } + F = F ( b ) − F ( a ) . {\displaystyle \int _{[a,b]}f(x)\,dx=\int _{[a,b]}\,dF=\int _{\partial [a,b]}\,F=\int _{\{a\}^{-}\cup \{b\}^{+}}F=F(b)-F(a)\,.} Formulation for smooth manifolds with boundary [ edit ] Let Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } be an oriented smooth manifold of dimension n {\displaystyle n} with boundary and let α {\displaystyle \alpha } be a smooth n {\displaystyle n} - differential form that is compactly supported on Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } . First, suppose that α {\displaystyle \alpha } is compactly supported in the domain of a single, oriented coordinate chart { U , φ } {\displaystyle \{U,\varphi \}} . In this case, we define the integral of α {\displaystyle \alpha } over Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } as ∫ Ω α = ∫ φ ( U ) ( φ − 1 ) ∗ α , {\displaystyle \int _{\Omega }\alpha =\int _{\varphi (U)}(\varphi ^{-1})^{*}\alpha \,,} i.e., via the pullback of α {\displaystyle \alpha } to R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} . More generally, the integral of α {\displaystyle \alpha } over Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } is defined as follows: Let { ψ i } {\displaystyle \{\psi _{i}\}} be a partition of unity associated with a locally finite cover { U i , φ i } {\displaystyle \{U_{i},\varphi _{i}\}} of (consistently oriented) coordinate charts, then define the integral ∫ Ω α ≡ ∑ i ∫ U i ψ i α , {\displaystyle \int _{\Omega }\alpha \equiv \sum _{i}\int _{U_{i}}\psi _{i}\alpha \,,} where each term in the sum is evaluated by pulling back to R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} as described above. This quantity is well-defined; that is, it does not depend on the choice of the coordinate charts, nor the partition of unity. The generalized Stokes theorem reads: Theorem ( Stokes–Cartan ) — Let ω {\displaystyle \omega } be a smooth ( n − 1 ) {\displaystyle (n-1)} - form with compact support on an oriented , n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional manifold-with-boundary Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } , where ∂ Ω {\displaystyle \partial \Omega } is given the induced orientation.Then ∫ Ω d ω = ∫ ∂ Ω ω . {\displaystyle \int _{\Omega }d\omega =\int _{\partial \Omega }\omega .} Here d {\displaystyle d} is the exterior derivative , which is defined using the manifold structure only. The right-hand side is sometimes written as ∮ ∂ Ω ω {\textstyle \oint _{\partial \Omega }\omega } to stress the fact that the ( n − 1 ) {\displaystyle (n-1)} -manifold ∂ Ω {\displaystyle \partial \Omega } has no boundary. [note 1] (This fact is also an implication of Stokes' theorem, since for a given smooth n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional manifold Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } , application of the theorem twice gives ∫ ∂ ( ∂ Ω ) ω = ∫ Ω d ( d ω ) = 0 {\textstyle \int _{\partial (\partial \Omega )}\omega =\int _{\Omega }d(d\omega )=0} for any ( n − 2 ) {\displaystyle (n-2)} -form ω {\displaystyle \omega } , which implies that ∂ ( ∂ Ω ) = ∅ {\displaystyle \partial (\partial \Omega )=\emptyset } .) The right-hand side of the equation is often used to formulate integral laws; the left-hand side then leads to equivalent differential formulations (see below). The theorem is often used in situations where Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } is an embedded oriented submanifold of some bigger manifold, often R k {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{k}} , on which the form ω {\displaystyle \omega } is defined. Topological preliminaries; integration over chains [ edit ] Let M be a smooth manifold . A (smooth) singular k -simplex in M is defined as a smooth map from the standard simplex in R k to M . The group C k ( M , Z ) of singular k - chains on M is defined to be the free abelian group on the set of singular k -simplices in M . These groups, together with the boundary map, ∂ , define a chain complex . The corresponding homology (resp. cohomology) group is isomorphic to the usual singular homology group H k ( M , Z ) (resp. the singular cohomology group H k ( M , Z ) ), defined using continuous rather than smooth simplices in M . On the other hand, the differential forms, with exterior derivative, d , as the connecting map, form a cochain complex, which defines the de Rham cohomology groups H d R k ( M , R ) {\displaystyle H_{dR}^{k}(M,\mathbf {R} )} . Differential k -forms can be integrated over a k -simplex in a natural way, by pulling back to R k . Extending by linearity allows one to integrate over chains. This gives a linear map from the space of k -forms to the k th group of singular cochains, C k ( M , Z ) , the linear functionals on C k ( M , Z ) . In other words, a k -form ω defines a functional I ( ω ) ( c ) = ∮ c ω . {\displaystyle I(\omega )(c)=\oint _{c}\omega .} on the k -chains. Stokes' theorem says that this is a chain map from de Rham cohomology to singular cohomology with real coefficients; the exterior derivative, d , behaves like the dual of ∂ on forms. This gives a homomorphism from de Rham cohomology to singular cohomology. On the level of forms, this means: closed forms, i.e., dω = 0 , have zero integral over boundaries , i.e. over manifolds that can be written as ∂Σ c M c , and exact forms, i.e., ω = dσ , have zero integral over cycles , i.e. if the boundaries sum up to the empty set: ∂Σ c M c = ∅ . De Rham's theorem shows that this homomorphism is in fact an isomorphism . So the converse to 1 and 2 above hold true. In other words, if { c i } are cycles generating the k th homology group, then for any corresponding real numbers, { a i } , there exist a closed form, ω , such that ∮ c i ω = a i , {\displaystyle \oint _{c_{i}}\omega =a_{i}\,,} and this form is unique up to exact forms. Stokes' theorem on smooth manifolds can be derived from Stokes' theorem for chains in smooth manifolds, and vice versa. [11] Formally stated, the latter reads: [12] Theorem ( Stokes' theorem for chains ) — If c is a smooth k -chain in a smooth manifold M , and ω is a smooth ( k − 1) -form on M , then ∫ ∂ c ω = ∫ c d ω . {\displaystyle \int _{\partial c}\omega =\int _{c}d\omega .} Underlying principle [ edit ] To simplify these topological arguments, it is worthwhile to examine the underlying principle by considering an example for d = 2 dimensions. The essential idea can be understood by the diagram on the left, which shows that, in an oriented tiling of a manifold, the interior paths are traversed in opposite directions; their contributions to the path integral thus cancel each other pairwise. As a consequence, only the contribution from the boundary remains. It thus suffices to prove Stokes' theorem for sufficiently fine tilings (or, equivalently, simplices ), which usually is not difficult. Classical vector analysis example [ edit ] Let γ : [ a , b ] → R 2 {\displaystyle \gamma :[a,b]\to \mathbb {R} ^{2}} be a piecewise smooth Jordan plane curve . The Jordan curve theorem implies that γ {\displaystyle \gamma } divides R 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}} into two components, a compact one and another that is non-compact. Let D {\displaystyle D} denote the compact part that is bounded by γ {\displaystyle \gamma } and suppose ψ : D → R 3 {\displaystyle \psi :D\to \mathbb {R} ^{3}} is smooth, with S = ψ ( D ) {\displaystyle S=\psi (D)} . If Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } is the space curve defined by Γ ( t ) = ψ ( γ ( t ) ) {\displaystyle \Gamma (t)=\psi (\gamma (t))} [note 2] and F {\displaystyle {\textbf {F}}} is a smooth vector field on R 3 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}} , then: [13] [14] [15] ∮ Γ F ⋅ d Γ = ∬ S ( ∇ × F ) ⋅ d S {\displaystyle \oint _{\Gamma }\mathbf {F} \,\cdot \,d{\mathbf {\Gamma } }=\iint _{S}\left(\nabla \times \mathbf {F} \right)\cdot \,d\mathbf {S} } This classical statement is a special case of the general formulation after making an identification of vector field with a 1-form and its curl with a two form through ( F x F y F z ) ⋅ d Γ → F x d x + F y d y + F z d z {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}F_{x}\\F_{y}\\F_{z}\\\end{pmatrix}}\cdot d\Gamma \to F_{x}\,dx+F_{y}\,dy+F_{z}\,dz} ∇ × ( F x F y F z ) ⋅ d S = ( ∂ y F z − ∂ z F y ∂ z F x − ∂ x F z ∂ x F y − ∂ y F x ) ⋅ d S → d ( F x d x + F y d y + F z d z ) = ( ∂ y F z − ∂ z F y ) d y ∧ d z + ( ∂ z F x − ∂ x F z ) d z ∧ d x + ( ∂ x F y − ∂ y F x ) d x ∧ d y . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&\nabla \times {\begin{pmatrix}F_{x}\\F_{y}\\F_{z}\end{pmatrix}}\cdot d\mathbf {S} ={\begin{pmatrix}\partial _{y}F_{z}-\partial _{z}F_{y}\\\partial _{z}F_{x}-\partial _{x}F_{z}\\\partial _{x}F_{y}-\partial _{y}F_{x}\\\end{pmatrix}}\cdot d\mathbf {S} \to \\[1.4ex]&d(F_{x}\,dx+F_{y}\,dy+F_{z}\,dz)=\left(\partial _{y}F_{z}-\partial _{z}F_{y}\right)dy\wedge dz+\left(\partial _{z}F_{x}-\partial _{x}F_{z}\right)dz\wedge dx+\left(\partial _{x}F_{y}-\partial _{y}F_{x}\right)dx\wedge dy.\end{aligned}}} Generalization to rough sets [ edit ] A region (here called D instead of Ω ) with piecewise smooth boundary. This is a manifold with corners , so its boundary is not a smooth manifold. The formulation above, in which Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } is a smooth manifold with boundary, does not suffice in many applications. For example, if the domain of integration is defined as the plane region between two x {\displaystyle x} -coordinates and the graphs of two functions, it will often happen that the domain has corners. In such a case, the corner points mean that Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } is not a smooth manifold with boundary, and so the statement of Stokes' theorem given above does not apply. Nevertheless, it is possible to check that the conclusion of Stokes' theorem is still true. This is because Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } and its boundary are well-behaved away from a small set of points (a measure zero set). A version of Stokes' theorem that allows for roughness was proved by Whitney. [16] Assume that D {\displaystyle D} is a connected bounded open subset of R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} . Call D {\displaystyle D} a standard domain if it satisfies the following property: there exists a subset P {\displaystyle P} of ∂ D {\displaystyle \partial D} , open in ∂ D {\displaystyle \partial D} , whose complement in ∂ D {\displaystyle \partial D} has Hausdorff ( n − 1 ) {\displaystyle (n-1)} -measure zero; and such that every point of P {\displaystyle P} has a generalized normal vector . This is a vector v ( x ) {\displaystyle {\textbf {v}}(x)} such that, if a coordinate system is chosen so that v ( x ) {\displaystyle {\textbf {v}}(x)} is the first basis vector, then, in an open neighborhood around x {\displaystyle x} , there exists a smooth function f ( x 2 , … , x n ) {\displaystyle f(x_{2},\dots ,x_{n})} such that P {\displaystyle P} is the graph { x 1 = f ( x 2 , … , x n ) } {\displaystyle \{x_{1}=f(x_{2},\dots ,x_{n})\}} and D {\displaystyle D} is the region { x 1 : x 1 < f ( x 2 , … , x n ) } {\displaystyle \{x_{1}:x_{1}<f(x_{2},\dots ,x_{n})\}} . Whitney remarks that the boundary of a standard domain is the union of a set of zero Hausdorff ( n − 1 ) {\displaystyle (n-1)} -measure and a finite or countable union of smooth ( n − 1 ) {\displaystyle (n-1)} -manifolds, each of which has the domain on only one side. He then proves that if D {\displaystyle D} is a standard domain in R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} , ω {\displaystyle \omega } is an ( n − 1 ) {\displaystyle (n-1)} -form which is defined, continuous, and bounded on D ∪ P {\displaystyle D\cup P} , smooth on D {\displaystyle D} , integrable on P {\displaystyle P} , and such that d ω {\displaystyle d\omega } is integrable on D {\displaystyle D} , then Stokes' theorem holds, that is, ∫ P ω = ∫ D d ω . {\displaystyle \int _{P}\omega =\int _{D}d\omega \,.} The study of measure-theoretic properties of rough sets leads to geometric measure theory . Even more general versions of Stokes' theorem have been proved by Federer and by Harrison. [17] Special cases [ edit ] The general form of the Stokes theorem using differential forms is more powerful and easier to use than the special cases. The traditional versions can be formulated using Cartesian coordinates without the machinery of differential geometry, and thus are more accessible. Further, they are older and their names are more familiar as a result. The traditional forms are often considered more convenient by practicing scientists and engineers but the non-naturalness of the traditional formulation becomes apparent when using other coordinate systems, even familiar ones like spherical or cylindrical coordinates. There is potential for confusion in the way names are applied, and the use of dual formulations. Classical (vector calculus) case [ edit ] Main article: Stokes' theorem An illustration of the vector-calculus Stokes theorem, with surface Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } , its boundary ∂ Σ {\displaystyle \partial \Sigma } and the ""normal"" vector n . This is a (dualized) (1 + 1)-dimensional case, for a 1-form (dualized because it is a statement about vector fields ). This special case is often just referred to as Stokes' theorem in many introductory university vector calculus courses and is used in physics and engineering. It is also sometimes known as the curl theorem. The classical Stokes' theorem relates the surface integral of the curl of a vector field over a surface Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } in Euclidean three-space to the line integral of the vector field over its boundary. It is a special case of the general Stokes theorem (with n = 2 {\displaystyle n=2} ) once we identify a vector field with a 1-form using the metric on Euclidean 3-space. The curve of the line integral, ∂ Σ {\displaystyle \partial \Sigma } , must have positive orientation , meaning that ∂ Σ {\displaystyle \partial \Sigma } points counterclockwise when the surface normal , n {\displaystyle n} , points toward the viewer. One consequence of this theorem is that the field lines of a vector field with zero curl cannot be closed contours. The formula can be rewritten as: Theorem — Suppose F = ( P ( x , y , z ) , Q ( x , y , z ) , R ( x , y , z ) ) {\displaystyle {\textbf {F}}={\big (}P(x,y,z),Q(x,y,z),R(x,y,z){\big )}} is defined in a region with smooth surface Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } and has continuous first-order partial derivatives . Then ∬ Σ ( ( ∂ R ∂ y − ∂ Q ∂ z ) d y d z + ( ∂ P ∂ z − ∂ R ∂ x ) d z d x + ( ∂ Q ∂ x − ∂ P ∂ y ) d x d y ) = ∮ ∂ Σ ( P d x + Q d y + R d z ) , {\displaystyle \iint _{\Sigma }{\Biggl (}\left({\frac {\partial R}{\partial y}}-{\frac {\partial Q}{\partial z}}\right)dy\,dz+\left({\frac {\partial P}{\partial z}}-{\frac {\partial R}{\partial x}}\right)dz\,dx+\left({\frac {\partial Q}{\partial x}}-{\frac {\partial P}{\partial y}}\right)dx\,dy{\Biggr )}=\oint _{\partial \Sigma }{\Big (}P\,dx+Q\,dy+R\,dz{\Big )}\,,} where P , Q {\displaystyle P,Q} and R {\displaystyle R} are the components of F {\displaystyle {\textbf {F}}} , and ∂ Σ {\displaystyle \partial \Sigma } is the boundary of the region Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } . Green's theorem [ edit ] Green's theorem is immediately recognizable as the third integrand of both sides in the integral in terms of P , Q , and R cited above. In electromagnetism [ edit ] Two of the four Maxwell equations involve curls of 3-D vector fields, and their differential and integral forms are related by the special 3-dimensional (vector calculus) case of Stokes' theorem . Caution must be taken to avoid cases with moving boundaries: the partial time derivatives are intended to exclude such cases. If moving boundaries are included, interchange of integration and differentiation introduces terms related to boundary motion not included in the results below (see Differentiation under the integral sign ): Name Differential form Integral form (using three-dimensional Stokes theorem plus relativistic invariance, ∫ ∂ ∂ t ⋯ → d d t ∫ ⋯ {\displaystyle \textstyle \int {\tfrac {\partial }{\partial t}}\dots \to {\tfrac {d}{dt}}\textstyle \int \cdots } ) Maxwell–Faraday equation Faraday's law of induction : ∇ × E = − ∂ B ∂ t {\displaystyle \nabla \times \mathbf {E} =-{\frac {\partial \mathbf {B} }{\partial t}}} ∮ C E ⋅ d l = ∬ S ∇ × E ⋅ d A = − ∬ S ∂ B ∂ t ⋅ d A {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\oint _{C}\mathbf {E} \cdot d\mathbf {l} &=\iint _{S}\nabla \times \mathbf {E} \cdot d\mathbf {A} \\&=-\iint _{S}{\frac {\partial \mathbf {B} }{\partial t}}\cdot d\mathbf {A} \end{aligned}}} (with C and S not necessarily stationary) Ampère's law (with Maxwell's extension): ∇ × H = J + ∂ D ∂ t {\displaystyle \nabla \times \mathbf {H} =\mathbf {J} +{\frac {\partial \mathbf {D} }{\partial t}}} ∮ C H ⋅ d l = ∬ S ∇ × H ⋅ d A = ∬ S J ⋅ d A + ∬ S ∂ D ∂ t ⋅ d A {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\oint _{C}\mathbf {H} \cdot d\mathbf {l} &=\iint _{S}\nabla \times \mathbf {H} \cdot d\mathbf {A} \\&=\iint _{S}\mathbf {J} \cdot d\mathbf {A} +\iint _{S}{\frac {\partial \mathbf {D} }{\partial t}}\cdot d\mathbf {A} \end{aligned}}} (with C and S not necessarily stationary) The above listed subset of Maxwell's equations are valid for electromagnetic fields expressed in SI units . In other systems of units, such as CGS or Gaussian units , the scaling factors for the terms differ. For example, in Gaussian units, Faraday's law of induction and Ampère's law take the forms: [18] [19] ∇ × E = − 1 c ∂ B ∂ t , ∇ × H = 1 c ∂ D ∂ t + 4 π c J , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\nabla \times \mathbf {E} &=-{\frac {1}{c}}{\frac {\partial \mathbf {B} }{\partial t}}\,,\\\nabla \times \mathbf {H} &={\frac {1}{c}}{\frac {\partial \mathbf {D} }{\partial t}}+{\frac {4\pi }{c}}\mathbf {J} \,,\end{aligned}}} respectively, where c is the speed of light in vacuum. Divergence theorem [ edit ] Likewise, the divergence theorem ∫ V o l ∇ ⋅ F d V o l = ∮ ∂ Vol F ⋅ d Σ {\displaystyle \int _{\mathrm {Vol} }\nabla \cdot \mathbf {F} \,d_{\mathrm {Vol} }=\oint _{\partial \operatorname {Vol} }\mathbf {F} \cdot d{\boldsymbol {\Sigma }}} is a special case if we identify a vector field with the ( n − 1 ) {\displaystyle (n-1)} -form obtained by contracting the vector field with the Euclidean volume form. An application of this is the case F = f c → {\displaystyle {\textbf {F}}=f{\vec {c}}} where c → {\displaystyle {\vec {c}}} is an arbitrary constant vector. Working out the divergence of the product gives c → ⋅ ∫ V o l ∇ f d V o l = c → ⋅ ∮ ∂ V o l f d Σ . {\displaystyle {\vec {c}}\cdot \int _{\mathrm {Vol} }\nabla f\,d_{\mathrm {Vol} }={\vec {c}}\cdot \oint _{\partial \mathrm {Vol} }f\,d{\boldsymbol {\Sigma }}\,.} Since this holds for all c → {\displaystyle {\vec {c}}} we find ∫ V o l ∇ f d V o l = ∮ ∂ V o l f d Σ . {\displaystyle \int _{\mathrm {Vol} }\nabla f\,d_{\mathrm {Vol} }=\oint _{\partial \mathrm {Vol} }f\,d{\boldsymbol {\Sigma }}\,.} Volume integral of gradient of scalar field [ edit ] Let f : Ω → R {\displaystyle f:\Omega \to \mathbb {R} } be a scalar field . Then ∫ Ω ∇ → f = ∫ ∂ Ω n → f {\displaystyle \int _{\Omega }{\vec {\nabla }}f=\int _{\partial \Omega }{\vec {n}}f} where n → {\displaystyle {\vec {n}}} is the normal vector to the surface ∂ Ω {\displaystyle \partial \Omega } at a given point. Proof: Let c → {\displaystyle {\vec {c}}} be a vector. Then 0 = ∫ Ω ∇ → ⋅ c → f − ∫ ∂ Ω n → ⋅ c → f by the divergence theorem = ∫ Ω c → ⋅ ∇ → f − ∫ ∂ Ω c → ⋅ n → f = c → ⋅ ∫ Ω ∇ → f − c → ⋅ ∫ ∂ Ω n → f = c → ⋅ ( ∫ Ω ∇ → f − ∫ ∂ Ω n → f ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}0&=\int _{\Omega }{\vec {\nabla }}\cdot {\vec {c}}f-\int _{\partial \Omega }{\vec {n}}\cdot {\vec {c}}f&{\text{by the divergence theorem}}\\&=\int _{\Omega }{\vec {c}}\cdot {\vec {\nabla }}f-\int _{\partial \Omega }{\vec {c}}\cdot {\vec {n}}f\\&={\vec {c}}\cdot \int _{\Omega }{\vec {\nabla }}f-{\vec {c}}\cdot \int _{\partial \Omega }{\vec {n}}f\\&={\vec {c}}\cdot \left(\int _{\Omega }{\vec {\nabla }}f-\int _{\partial \Omega }{\vec {n}}f\right)\end{aligned}}} Since this holds for any c → {\displaystyle {\vec {c}}} (in particular, for every basis vector ), the result follows.

However, one should keep in mind here that in thermodynamics , where frequently expressions as ∮ W { d total U } {\displaystyle \oint _{W}\{{\text{d}}_{\text{total}}U\}} appear (wherein the total derivative, see below, should not be confused with the exterior one), the integration path W {\displaystyle W} is a one-dimensional closed line on a much higher-dimensional manifold.

Velocity (blue line) and particle excursion (red dots) as a function of the distance to the wall. In fluid dynamics, Stokes problem also known as Stokes second problem or sometimes referred to as Stokes boundary layer or Oscillating boundary layer is a problem of determining the flow created by an oscillating solid surface, named after Sir George Stokes . This is considered one of the simplest unsteady problems that has an exact solution for the Navier–Stokes equations . [1] [2] In turbulent flow, this is still named a Stokes boundary layer, but now one has to rely on experiments , numerical simulations or approximate methods in order to obtain useful information on the flow. Flow description [3] [4] [ edit ] Consider an infinitely long plate which is oscillating with a velocity U cos ⁡ ω t {\displaystyle U\cos \omega t} in the x {\displaystyle x} direction, which is located at y = 0 {\displaystyle y=0} in an infinite domain of fluid, where ω {\displaystyle \omega } is the frequency of the oscillations. The incompressible Navier–Stokes equations reduce to ∂ u ∂ t = ν ∂ 2 u ∂ y 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial u}{\partial t}}=\nu {\frac {\partial ^{2}u}{\partial y^{2}}}} where ν {\displaystyle \nu } is the kinematic viscosity . The pressure gradient does not enter into the problem. The initial, no-slip condition on the wall is u ( 0 , t ) = U cos ⁡ ω t , u ( ∞ , t ) = 0 , {\displaystyle u(0,t)=U\cos \omega t,\quad u(\infty ,t)=0,} and the second boundary condition is due to the fact that the motion at y = 0 {\displaystyle y=0} is not felt at infinity. The flow is only due to the motion of the plate, there is no imposed pressure gradient. Solution [5] [6] [ edit ] The initial condition is not required because of periodicity. Since both the equation and the boundary conditions are linear, the velocity can be written as the real part of some complex function u = U ℜ [ e i ω t f ( y ) ] {\displaystyle u=U\Re \left[e^{i\omega t}f(y)\right]} because cos ⁡ ω t = ℜ e i ω t {\displaystyle \cos \omega t=\Re e^{i\omega t}} . Substituting this into the partial differential equation reduces it to ordinary differential equation f ″ − i ω ν f = 0 {\displaystyle f''-{\frac {i\omega }{\nu }}f=0} with boundary conditions f ( 0 ) = 1 , f ( ∞ ) = 0 {\displaystyle f(0)=1,\quad f(\infty )=0} The solution to the above problem is f ( y ) = exp ⁡ [ − 1 + i 2 ω ν y ] {\displaystyle f(y)=\exp \left[-{\frac {1+i}{\sqrt {2}}}{\sqrt {\frac {\omega }{\nu }}}y\right]} u ( y , t ) = U e − ω 2 ν y cos ⁡ ( ω t − ω 2 ν y ) {\displaystyle u(y,t)=Ue^{-{\sqrt {\frac {\omega }{2\nu }}}y}\cos \left(\omega t-{\sqrt {\frac {\omega }{2\nu }}}y\right)} The disturbance created by the oscillating plate travels as the transverse wave through the fluid, but it is highly damped by the exponential factor. The depth of penetration δ = 2 ν / ω {\displaystyle \delta ={\sqrt {2\nu /\omega }}} of this wave decreases with the frequency of the oscillation, but increases with the kinematic viscosity of the fluid. The force per unit area exerted on the plate by the fluid is F = μ ( ∂ u ∂ y ) y = 0 = ρ ω μ U cos ⁡ ( ω t − π 4 ) {\displaystyle F=\mu \left({\frac {\partial u}{\partial y}}\right)_{y=0}={\sqrt {\rho \omega \mu }}U\cos \left(\omega t-{\frac {\pi }{4}}\right)} There is a phase shift between the oscillation of the plate and the force created. Vorticity oscillations near the boundary [ edit ] An important observation from Stokes' solution for the oscillating Stokes flow is that vorticity oscillations are confined to a thin boundary layer and damp exponentially when moving away from the wall. [7] This observation is also valid for the case of a turbulent boundary layer. Outside the Stokes boundary layer – which is often the bulk of the fluid volume – the vorticity oscillations may be neglected. To good approximation, the flow velocity oscillations are irrotational outside the boundary layer, and potential flow theory can be applied to the oscillatory part of the motion. This significantly simplifies the solution of these flow problems, and is often applied in the irrotational flow regions of sound waves and water waves . Fluid bounded by an upper wall [ edit ] If the fluid domain is bounded by an upper, stationary wall, located at a height y = h {\displaystyle y=h} , the flow velocity is given by u ( y , t ) = U 2 ( cosh ⁡ 2 λ h − cos ⁡ 2 λ h ) [ e − λ ( y − 2 h ) cos ⁡ ( ω t − λ y ) + e λ ( y − 2 h ) cos ⁡ ( ω t + λ y ) − e − λ y cos ⁡ ( ω t − λ y + 2 λ h ) − e λ y cos ⁡ ( ω t + λ y − 2 λ h ) ] {\displaystyle u(y,t)={\frac {U}{2(\cosh 2\lambda h-\cos 2\lambda h)}}[e^{-\lambda (y-2h)}\cos(\omega t-\lambda y)+e^{\lambda (y-2h)}\cos(\omega t+\lambda y)-e^{-\lambda y}\cos(\omega t-\lambda y+2\lambda h)-e^{\lambda y}\cos(\omega t+\lambda y-2\lambda h)]} where λ = ω / ( 2 ν ) {\displaystyle \lambda ={\sqrt {\omega /(2\nu )}}} . Fluid bounded by a free surface [ edit ] Suppose the extent of the fluid domain be 0 < y < h {\displaystyle 0<y<h} with y = h {\displaystyle y=h} representing a free surface. Then the solution as shown by Chia-Shun Yih in 1968 [8] is given by u ( y , t ) = U cos ⁡ h / δ c o s h h / δ 2 ( cos 2 ⁡ h / δ + s i n h 2 h / δ ) ℜ { W + W ∗ − i t a n h h / δ tan ⁡ h / δ ( W − W ∗ ) } , W = c o s h [ ( 1 + i ) ( h − y ) / δ ] e i ω t {\displaystyle u(y,t)={\frac {U\cos h/\delta \,\mathrm {cosh} \,h/\delta }{2(\cos ^{2}h/\delta +\mathrm {sinh} ^{2}h/\delta )}}\Re \left\{W+W^{*}-i\mathrm {tanh} \,h/\delta \,\tan h/\delta \,(W-W^{*})\right\},\qquad W=\mathrm {cosh} [(1+i)(h-y)/\delta ]e^{i\omega t}} where δ = 2 ν / ω . {\displaystyle \delta ={\sqrt {2\nu /\omega }}.} Flow due to an oscillating pressure gradient near a plane rigid plate [ edit ] Stokes boundary layer due to the sinusoidal oscillation of the far-field flow velocity. The horizontal velocity is the blue line, and the corresponding horizontal particle excursions are the red dots. The case for an oscillating far-field flow, with the plate held at rest, can easily be constructed from the previous solution for an oscillating plate by using linear superposition of solutions. Consider a uniform velocity oscillation u ( ∞ , t ) = U ∞ cos ⁡ ω t {\displaystyle u(\infty ,t)=U_{\infty }\cos \omega t} far away from the plate and a vanishing velocity at the plate u ( 0 , t ) = 0 {\displaystyle u(0,t)=0} . Unlike the stationary fluid in the original problem, the pressure gradient here at infinity must be a harmonic function of time. The solution is then given by u ( y , t ) = U ∞ [ cos ⁡ ω t − e − ω 2 ν y cos ⁡ ( ω t − ω 2 ν y ) ] , {\displaystyle u(y,t)=U_{\infty }\left[\,\cos \omega t-{\text{e}}^{-{\sqrt {\frac {\omega }{2\nu }}}y}\,\cos \left(\omega t-{\sqrt {\frac {\omega }{2\nu }}}y\right)\right],} which is zero at the wall y = 0 , corresponding with the no-slip condition for a wall at rest. This situation is often encountered in sound waves near a solid wall, or for the fluid motion near the sea bed in water waves . The vorticity, for the oscillating flow near a wall at rest, is equal to the vorticity in case of an oscillating plate but of opposite sign. Stokes problem in cylindrical geometry [ edit ] Torsional oscillation [ edit ] Consider an infinitely long cylinder of radius a {\displaystyle a} exhibiting torsional oscillation with angular velocity Ω cos ⁡ ω t {\displaystyle \Omega \cos \omega t} where ω {\displaystyle \omega } is the frequency. Then the velocity approaches after the initial transient phase to [9] v θ = a Ω ℜ [ K 1 ( r i ω / ν ) K 1 ( a i ω / ν ) e i ω t ] {\displaystyle v_{\theta }=a\Omega \ \Re \left[{\frac {K_{1}(r{\sqrt {i\omega /\nu }})}{K_{1}(a{\sqrt {i\omega /\nu }})}}e^{i\omega t}\right]} where K 1 {\displaystyle K_{1}} is the modified Bessel function of the second kind. This solution can be expressed with real argument [10] as: v θ ( r , t ) = Ψ { [ kei 1 ( R ω ) kei 1 ( R ω r ) + ker 1 ( R ω ) ker 1 ( R ω r ) ] cos ⁡ ( t ) + [ kei 1 ( R ω ) ker 1 ( R ω r ) − ker 1 ( R ω ) kei 1 ( R ω r ) ] sin ⁡ ( t ) } {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}v_{\theta }\left(r,t\right)&=\Psi \left\lbrace \left[{\textrm {kei}}_{1}\left({\sqrt {R_{\omega }}}\right){\textrm {kei}}_{1}\left({\sqrt {R_{\omega }}}r\right)+{\textrm {ker}}_{1}\left({\sqrt {R_{\omega }}}\right){\textrm {ker}}_{1}\left({\sqrt {R_{\omega }}}r\right)\right]\cos \left(t\right)\right.\\&+\left.\left[{\textrm {kei}}_{1}\left({\sqrt {R_{\omega }}}\right){\textrm {ker}}_{1}\left({\sqrt {R_{\omega }}}r\right)-{\textrm {ker}}_{1}\left({\sqrt {R_{\omega }}}\right){\textrm {kei}}_{1}\left({\sqrt {R_{\omega }}}r\right)\right]\sin \left(t\right)\right\rbrace \\\end{aligned}}} where Ψ = [ kei 1 2 ( R ω ) + ker 1 2 ( R ω ) ] − 1 , {\displaystyle \Psi =\left[{\textrm {kei}}_{1}^{2}\left({\sqrt {R_{\omega }}}\right)+{\textrm {ker}}_{1}^{2}\left({\sqrt {R_{\omega }}}\right)\right]^{-1},} k e i {\displaystyle \mathrm {kei} } and k e r {\displaystyle \mathrm {ker} } are Kelvin functions and R ω {\displaystyle R_{\omega }} is to the dimensionless oscillatory Reynolds number defined as R ω = ω a 2 / ν {\displaystyle R_{\omega }=\omega a^{2}/\nu } , being ν {\displaystyle \nu } the kinematic viscosity. Axial oscillation [ edit ] If the cylinder oscillates in the axial direction with velocity U cos ⁡ ω t {\displaystyle U\cos \omega t} , then the velocity field is u = U ℜ [ K 0 ( r i ω / ν ) K 0 ( a i ω / ν ) e i ω t ] {\displaystyle u=U\ \Re \left[{\frac {K_{0}(r{\sqrt {i\omega /\nu }})}{K_{0}(a{\sqrt {i\omega /\nu }})}}e^{i\omega t}\right]} where K 0 {\displaystyle K_{0}} is the modified Bessel function of the second kind. Stokes–Couette flow [11] [ edit ] In the Couette flow , instead of the translational motion of one of the plate, an oscillation of one plane will be executed. If we have a bottom wall at rest at y = 0 {\displaystyle y=0} and the upper wall at y = h {\displaystyle y=h} is executing an oscillatory motion with velocity U cos ⁡ ω t {\displaystyle U\cos \omega t} , then the velocity field is given by u = U ℜ { sin ⁡ k y sin ⁡ k h } , where k = 1 + i 2 ω ν . {\displaystyle u=U\ \Re \left\{{\frac {\sin ky}{\sin kh}}\right\},\quad {\text{where}}\quad k={\frac {1+i}{\sqrt {2}}}{\sqrt {\frac {\omega }{\nu }}}.} The frictional force per unit area on the moving plane is − μ U ℜ { k cot ⁡ k h } {\displaystyle -\mu U\Re \{k\cot kh\}} and on the fixed plane is μ U ℜ { k csc ⁡ k h } {\displaystyle \mu U\Re \{k\csc kh\}} .

Eigenforms fall into the realm of number theory , but can be found in other areas of math and science such as analysis , combinatorics , and physics . A common example of an eigenform, and the only non-cuspidal eigenforms, are the Eisenstein series . Another example is the Δ Function . Normalization [ edit ] There are two different normalizations for an eigenform (or for a modular form in general). Algebraic normalization [ edit ] An eigenform is said to be normalized when scaled so that the q -coefficient in its Fourier series is one: f = a 0 + q + ∑ i = 2 ∞ a i q i {\displaystyle f=a_{0}+q+\sum _{i=2}^{\infty }a_{i}q^{i}} where q = e 2 πiz . As the function f is also an eigenvector under each Hecke operator T i , it has a corresponding eigenvalue. More specifically a i , i ≥ 1 turns out to be the eigenvalue of f corresponding to the Hecke operator T i . In the case when f is not a cusp form, the eigenvalues can be given explicitly. [1] Analytic normalization [ edit ] An eigenform which is cuspidal can be normalized with respect to its inner product : ⟨ f , f ⟩ = 1 {\displaystyle \langle f,f\rangle =1\,} Existence [ edit ] The existence of eigenforms is a nontrivial result, but does come directly from the fact that the Hecke algebra is commutative. Higher levels [ edit ] In the case that the modular group is not the full SL(2, Z ), there is not a Hecke operator for each n ∈ Z , and as such the definition of an eigenform is changed accordingly: an eigenform is a modular form which is a simultaneous eigenvector for all Hecke operators that act on the space. In cybernetics [ edit ] In cybernetics , the notion of an eigenform is understood as an example of a reflexive system. It plays an important role in the work of Heinz von Foerster , [2] and is ""inextricably linked with second order cybernetics "". [3] References [ edit ] ^ Neal Koblitz (1984). ""III.5"".

In mathematics , the Hecke algebra is the algebra generated by Hecke operators , which are named after Erich Hecke . Properties [ edit ] The algebra is a commutative ring . [1] [2] In the classical elliptic modular form theory, the Hecke operators T n with n coprime to the level acting on the space of cusp forms of a given weight are self-adjoint with respect to the Petersson inner product . [3] Therefore, the spectral theorem implies that there is a basis of modular forms that are eigenfunctions for these Hecke operators. Each of these basic forms possesses an Euler product . More precisely, its Mellin transform is the Dirichlet series that has Euler products with the local factor for each prime p is the reciprocal of the Hecke polynomial , a quadratic polynomial in p − s . [4] [5] In the case treated by Mordell, the space of cusp forms of weight 12 with respect to the full modular group is one-dimensional. It follows that the Ramanujan form has an Euler product and establishes the multiplicativity of τ ( n ). [6] Generalizations [ edit ] The classical Hecke algebra has been generalized to other settings, such as the Hecke algebra of a locally compact group and spherical Hecke algebra that arise when modular forms and other automorphic forms are viewed using adelic groups .

In mathematics, an affine Hecke algebra is the algebra associated to an affine Weyl group , and can be used to prove Macdonald's constant term conjecture for Macdonald polynomials . Definition [ edit ] Let V {\displaystyle V} be a Euclidean space of a finite dimension and Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } an affine root system on V {\displaystyle V} . An affine Hecke algebra is a certain associative algebra that deforms the group algebra C [ W ] {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} [W]} of the Weyl group W {\displaystyle W} of Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } (the affine Weyl group ). It is usually denoted by H ( Σ , q ) {\displaystyle H(\Sigma ,q)} , where q : Σ → C {\displaystyle q:\Sigma \rightarrow \mathbb {C} } is multiplicity function that plays the role of deformation parameter. For q ≡ 1 {\displaystyle q\equiv 1} the affine Hecke algebra H ( Σ , q ) {\displaystyle H(\Sigma ,q)} indeed reduces to C [ W ] {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} [W]} . Generalizations [ edit ] Ivan Cherednik introduced generalizations of affine Hecke algebras, the so-called double affine Hecke algebra (usually referred to as DAHA). Using this he was able to give a proof of Macdonald's constant term conjecture for Macdonald polynomials (building on work of Eric Opdam ). Another main inspiration for Cherednik to consider the double affine Hecke algebra was the quantum KZ equations . References [ edit ] Cherednik, Ivan (2005). Double affine Hecke algebras .

Please help improve this article by introducing more precise citations. ( June 2020 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In mathematics, the Iwahori–Hecke algebra , or Hecke algebra , named for Erich Hecke and Nagayoshi Iwahori , is a deformation of the group algebra of a Coxeter group . Hecke algebras are quotients of the group rings of Artin braid groups . This connection found a spectacular application in Vaughan Jones ' construction of new invariants of knots . Representations of Hecke algebras led to discovery of quantum groups by Michio Jimbo . Michael Freedman proposed Hecke algebras as a foundation for topological quantum computation . Hecke algebras of Coxeter groups [ edit ] Start with the following data: ( W , S ) is a Coxeter system with the Coxeter matrix M = ( m st ), R is a commutative ring with identity. { q s | s ∈ S } is a family of units of R such that q s = q t whenever s and t are conjugate in W A is the ring of Laurent polynomials over Z with indeterminates q s (and the above restriction that q s = q t whenever s and t are conjugated), that is A = Z [ q ±1 s ] Multiparameter Hecke Algebras [ edit ] The multiparameter Hecke algebra H R (W,S,q) is a unital, associative R -algebra with generators T s for all s ∈ S and relations: Braid Relations: T s T t T s ... = T t T s T t ..., where each side has m st < ∞ factors and s,t belong to S . Quadratic Relation: For all s in S we have: ( T s - q s )( T s + 1) = 0. Warning : in later books and papers, Lusztig used a modified form of the quadratic relation that reads ( T s − q s 1 / 2 ) ( T s + q s − 1 / 2 ) = 0. {\displaystyle (T_{s}-q_{s}^{1/2})(T_{s}+q_{s}^{-1/2})=0.} After extending the scalars to include the half integer powers q ±1/2 s the resulting Hecke algebra is isomorphic to the previously defined one (but the T s here corresponds to q -1/2 s T s in our notation). While this does not change the general theory, many formulae look different. Generic Multiparameter Hecke Algebras [ edit ] H A (W,S,q) is the generic multiparameter Hecke algebra. This algebra is universal in the sense that every other multiparameter Hecke algebra can be obtained from it via the (unique) ring homomorphism A → R which maps the indeterminate q s ∈ A to the unit q s ∈ R . This homomorphism turns R into a A -algebra and the scalar extension H A (W,S) ⊗ A R is canonically isomorphic to the Hecke algebra H R (W,S,q) as constructed above. One calls this process specialization of the generic algebra. One-parameter Hecke Algebras [ edit ] If one specializes every indeterminate q s to a single indeterminate q over the integers (or q 1/2 s to q 1/2 respectively), then one obtains the so-called generic one-parameter Hecke algebra of (W,S) . Since in Coxeter groups with single laced Dynkin diagrams (for example groups of type A and D) every pair of Coxeter generators is conjugated, the above-mentioned restriction of q s being equal q t whenever s and t are conjugated in W forces the multiparameter and the one-parameter Hecke algebras to be equal. Therefore, it is also very common to only look at one-parameter Hecke algebras. Coxeter groups with weights [ edit ] If an integral weight function is defined on W (i.e. a map L:W → Z with L(vw)=L(v)+L(w) for all v,w ∈ W with l(vw)=l(v)+l(w) ), then a common specialization to look at is the one induced by the homomorphism q s ↦ q L(s) , where q is a single indeterminate over Z . If one uses the convention with half-integer powers, then weight function L:W → ⁠ 1 / 2 ⁠ Z may be permitted as well. For technical reasons it is also often convenient only to consider positive weight functions. Properties [ edit ] 1. The Hecke algebra has a basis ( T w ) w ∈ W {\displaystyle (T_{w})_{w\in W}} over A indexed by the elements of the Coxeter group W . In particular, H is a free A -module. If w = s 1 s 2 … s n {\displaystyle w=s_{1}s_{2}\ldots s_{n}} is a reduced decomposition of w ∈ W , then T w = T s 1 T s 2 … T s n {\displaystyle T_{w}=T_{s_{1}}T_{s_{2}}\ldots T_{s_{n}}} . This basis of Hecke algebra is sometimes called the natural basis . The neutral element of W corresponds to the identity of H : T e = 1. 2. The elements of the natural basis are multiplicative , namely, T yw = T y T w whenever l(yw)=l(y)+l(w) , where l denotes the length function on the Coxeter group W . 3. Elements of the natural basis are invertible. For example, from the quadratic relation we conclude that T −1 s = q −1 s T s + ( q −1 s -1). 4. Suppose that W is a finite group and the ground ring is the field C of complex numbers. Jacques Tits has proved that if the indeterminate q is specialized to any complex number outside of an explicitly given list (consisting of roots of unity), then the resulting one parameter Hecke algebra is semisimple and isomorphic to the complex group algebra C [ W ] (which also corresponds to the specialization q ↦ 1) [ citation needed ] . 5. More generally, if W is a finite group and the ground ring R is a field of characteristic zero , then the one parameter Hecke algebra is a semisimple associative algebra over R [ q ±1 ]. Moreover, extending earlier results of Benson and Curtis, George Lusztig provided an explicit isomorphism between the Hecke algebra and the group algebra after the extension of scalars to the quotient field of R [ q ±1/2 ] Canonical basis [ edit ] Main article: Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomial A great discovery of Kazhdan and Lusztig was that a Hecke algebra admits a different basis, which in a way controls representation theory of a variety of related objects. The generic multiparameter Hecke algebra, H A (W,S,q) , has an involution bar that maps q 1/2 to q −1/2 and acts as identity on Z . Then H admits a unique ring automorphism i that is semilinear with respect to the bar involution of A and maps T s to T −1 s . It can further be proved that this automorphism is involutive (has order two) and takes any T w to T w − 1 − 1 . {\displaystyle T_{w^{-1}}^{-1}.} Kazhdan - Lusztig Theorem: For each w ∈ W there exists a unique element C w ′ {\displaystyle C_{w}^{\prime }} which is invariant under the involution i and if one writes its expansion in terms of the natural basis: C w ′ = ( q − 1 / 2 ) l ( w ) ∑ y ≤ w P y , w T y , {\displaystyle C'_{w}=\left(q^{-1/2}\right)^{l(w)}\sum _{y\leq w}P_{y,w}T_{y},} one has the following: P w,w =1, P y,w in Z [ q ] has degree less than or equal to ⁠ 1 / 2 ⁠ (l(w)-l(y)-1) if y<w in the Bruhat order , P y,w =0 if y ≰ w . {\displaystyle y\nleq w.} The elements C w ′ {\displaystyle C_{w}^{\prime }} where w varies over W form a basis of the algebra H , which is called the dual canonical basis of the Hecke algebra H . The canonical basis { C w | w ∈ W } is obtained in a similar way. The polynomials P y,w ( q ) making appearance in this theorem are the Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials . The Kazhdan–Lusztig notions of left, right and two-sided cells in Coxeter groups are defined through the behavior of the canonical basis under the action of H . Hecke algebra of a locally compact group [ edit ] Main article: Hecke algebra of a locally compact group Iwahori–Hecke algebras first appeared as an important special case of a very general construction in group theory. Let (G,K) be a pair consisting of a unimodular locally compact topological group G and a closed subgroup K of G . Then the space of K -biinvariant continuous functions of compact support , C c (K\G/K) , can be endowed with a structure of an associative algebra under the operation of convolution . This algebra is denoted by H(G//K) and called the Hecke ring of the pair (G,K) . Example: If G = SL( n , Q p ) and K = SL( n , Z p ) then the Hecke ring is commutative and its representations were studied by Ian G. Macdonald . More generally if (G,K) is a Gelfand pair then the resulting algebra turns out to be commutative. Example: If G = SL(2, Q ) and K = SL(2, Z ) we get the abstract ring behind Hecke operators in the theory of modular forms , which gave the name to Hecke algebras in general. The case leading to the Hecke algebra of a finite Weyl group is when G is the finite Chevalley group over a finite field with p k elements, and B is its Borel subgroup . Iwahori showed that the Hecke ring H(G//B) is obtained from the generic Hecke algebra H q of the Weyl group W of G by specializing the indeterminate q of the latter algebra to p k , the cardinality of the finite field. George Lusztig remarked in 1984 ( Characters of reductive groups over a finite field , xi, footnote): I think it would be most appropriate to call it the Iwahori algebra, but the name Hecke ring (or algebra) given by Iwahori himself has been in use for almost 20 years and it is probably too late to change it now. Iwahori and Matsumoto (1965) considered the case when G is a group of points of a reductive algebraic group over a non-archimedean local field K , such as Q p , and K is what is now called an Iwahori subgroup of G . The resulting Hecke ring is isomorphic to the Hecke algebra of the affine Weyl group of G , or the affine Hecke algebra , where the indeterminate q has been specialized to the cardinality of the residue field of K . Work of Roger Howe in the 1970s and his papers with Allen Moy on representations of p -adic GL( n ) opened a possibility of classifying irreducible admissible representations of reductive groups over local fields in terms of appropriately constructed Hecke algebras. (Important contributions were also made by Joseph Bernstein and Andrey Zelevinsky .) These ideas were taken much further in Colin Bushnell and Philip Kutzko 's theory of types , allowing them to complete the classification in the general linear case. Many of the techniques can be extended to other reductive groups, which remains an area of active research. It has been conjectured that all Hecke algebras that are ever needed are mild generalizations of affine Hecke algebras. Representations of Hecke algebras [ edit ] It follows from Iwahori's work that complex representations of Hecke algebras of finite type are intimately related with the structure of the spherical principal series representations of finite Chevalley groups. George Lusztig pushed this connection much further and was able to describe most of the characters of finite groups of Lie type in terms of representation theory of Hecke algebras. This work used a mixture of geometric techniques and various reductions, led to introduction of various objects generalizing Hecke algebras and detailed understanding of their representations (for q not a root of unity). Modular representations of Hecke algebras and representations at roots of unity turned out to be related with the theory of canonical bases in affine quantum groups and combinatorics. Representation theory of affine Hecke algebras was developed by Lusztig with a view towards applying it to description of representations of p -adic groups. It is different in many ways [ how? ] from the finite case. A generalization of affine Hecke algebras, called double affine Hecke algebra , was used by Ivan Cherednik in his proof of the Macdonald's constant term conjecture .

History [ edit ] Mordell ( 1917 ) used Hecke operators on modular forms in a paper on the special cusp form of Ramanujan , ahead of the general theory given by Hecke ( 1937a,1937b ). Mordell proved that the Ramanujan tau function , expressing the coefficients of the Ramanujan form, Δ ( z ) = q ( ∏ n = 1 ∞ ( 1 − q n ) ) 24 = ∑ n = 1 ∞ τ ( n ) q n , q = e 2 π i z , {\displaystyle \Delta (z)=q\left(\prod _{n=1}^{\infty }(1-q^{n})\right)^{24}=\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }\tau (n)q^{n},\quad q=e^{2\pi iz},} is a multiplicative function : τ ( m n ) = τ ( m ) τ ( n ) for ( m , n ) = 1. {\displaystyle \tau (mn)=\tau (m)\tau (n)\quad {\text{ for }}(m,n)=1.} The idea goes back to earlier work of Adolf Hurwitz , who treated algebraic correspondences between modular curves which realise some individual Hecke operators. Mathematical description [ edit ] Hecke operators can be realized in a number of contexts. The simplest meaning is combinatorial, namely as taking for a given integer n some function f ( Λ ) defined on the lattices of fixed rank to ∑ f ( Λ ′ ) {\displaystyle \sum f(\Lambda ')} with the sum taken over all the Λ′ that are subgroups of Λ of index n . For example, with n=2 and two dimensions, there are three such Λ′ . Modular forms are particular kinds of functions of a lattice, subject to conditions making them analytic functions and homogeneous with respect to homotheties , as well as moderate growth at infinity; these conditions are preserved by the summation, and so Hecke operators preserve the space of modular forms of a given weight. Another way to express Hecke operators is by means of double cosets in the modular group . In the contemporary adelic approach, this translates to double cosets with respect to some compact subgroups. Explicit formula [ edit ] Let M m be the set of 2×2 integral matrices with determinant m and Γ = M 1 be the full modular group SL (2, Z ) . Given a modular form f ( z ) of weight k , the m th Hecke operator acts by the formula T m f ( z ) = m k − 1 ∑ ( a b c d ) ∈ Γ ∖ M m ( c z + d ) − k f ( a z + b c z + d ) , {\displaystyle T_{m}f(z)=m^{k-1}\sum _{\left({\begin{smallmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{smallmatrix}}\right)\in \Gamma \backslash M_{m}}(cz+d)^{-k}f\left({\frac {az+b}{cz+d}}\right),} where z is in the upper half-plane and the normalization constant m k −1 assures that the image of a form with integer Fourier coefficients has integer Fourier coefficients. This can be rewritten in the form T m f ( z ) = m k − 1 ∑ a , d > 0 , a d = m 1 d k ∑ b ( mod d ) f ( a z + b d ) , {\displaystyle T_{m}f(z)=m^{k-1}\sum _{a,d>0,ad=m}{\frac {1}{d^{k}}}\sum _{b{\pmod {d}}}f\left({\frac {az+b}{d}}\right),} which leads to the formula for the Fourier coefficients of T m ( f ( z )) = Σ b n q n in terms of the Fourier coefficients of f ( z ) = Σ a n q n : b n = ∑ r > 0 , r | ( m , n ) r k − 1 a m n / r 2 . {\displaystyle b_{n}=\sum _{r>0,r|(m,n)}r^{k-1}a_{mn/r^{2}}.} One can see from this explicit formula that Hecke operators with different indices commute and that if a 0 = 0 then b 0 = 0 , so the subspace S k of cusp forms of weight k is preserved by the Hecke operators. If a (non-zero) cusp form f is a simultaneous eigenform of all Hecke operators T m with eigenvalues λ m then a m = λ m a 1 and a 1 ≠ 0 . Hecke eigenforms are normalized so that a 1 = 1 , then T m f = a m f , a m a n = ∑ r > 0 , r | ( m , n ) r k − 1 a m n / r 2 , m , n ≥ 1. {\displaystyle T_{m}f=a_{m}f,\quad a_{m}a_{n}=\sum _{r>0,r|(m,n)}r^{k-1}a_{mn/r^{2}},\ m,n\geq 1.} Thus for normalized cuspidal Hecke eigenforms of integer weight, their Fourier coefficients coincide with their Hecke eigenvalues. Hecke algebras [ edit ] Main article: Hecke algebra Algebras of Hecke operators are called ""Hecke algebras"", and are commutative rings . In the classical elliptic modular form theory, the Hecke operators T n with n coprime to the level acting on the space of cusp forms of a given weight are self-adjoint with respect to the Petersson inner product . Therefore, the spectral theorem implies that there is a basis of modular forms that are eigenfunctions for these Hecke operators. Each of these basic forms possesses an Euler product . More precisely, its Mellin transform is the Dirichlet series that has Euler products with the local factor for each prime p is the inverse [ clarification needed ] of the Hecke polynomial , a quadratic polynomial in p − s . In the case treated by Mordell, the space of cusp forms of weight 12 with respect to the full modular group is one-dimensional. It follows that the Ramanujan form has an Euler product and establishes the multiplicativity of τ ( n ) . Other related mathematical rings are also called ""Hecke algebras"", although sometimes the link to Hecke operators is not entirely obvious. These algebras include certain quotients of the group algebras of braid groups . The presence of this commutative operator algebra plays a significant role in the harmonic analysis of modular forms and generalisations.

A very simple example is the subgroup of invertible 2 × 2 integer matrices of determinant 1 in which the off-diagonal entries are even . More generally, the notion of congruence subgroup can be defined for arithmetic subgroups of algebraic groups ; that is, those for which we have a notion of 'integral structure' and can define reduction maps modulo an integer. The existence of congruence subgroups in an arithmetic group provides it with a wealth of subgroups, in particular it shows that the group is residually finite . An important question regarding the algebraic structure of arithmetic groups is the congruence subgroup problem , which asks whether all subgroups of finite index are essentially congruence subgroups. Congruence subgroups of 2 × 2 matrices are fundamental objects in the classical theory of modular forms ; the modern theory of automorphic forms makes a similar use of congruence subgroups in more general arithmetic groups. Congruence subgroups of the modular group [ edit ] The simplest interesting setting in which congruence subgroups can be studied is that of the modular group ⁠ S L 2 ( Z ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {SL} _{2}(\mathbb {Z} )} ⁠ . [1] Principal congruence subgroups [ edit ] If n ⩾ 1 {\displaystyle n\geqslant 1} is an integer there is a homomorphism π n : S L 2 ( Z ) → S L 2 ( Z / n Z ) {\displaystyle \pi _{n}:\mathrm {SL} _{2}(\mathbb {Z} )\to \mathrm {SL} _{2}(\mathbb {Z} /n\mathbb {Z} )} induced by the reduction modulo n {\displaystyle n} morphism ⁠ Z → Z / n Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} \to \mathbb {Z} /n\mathbb {Z} } ⁠ . The principal congruence subgroup of level n {\displaystyle n} in Γ = S L 2 ( Z ) {\displaystyle \Gamma =\mathrm {SL} _{2}(\mathbb {Z} )} is the kernel of ⁠ π n {\displaystyle \pi _{n}} ⁠ , and it is usually denoted ⁠ Γ ( n ) {\displaystyle \Gamma (n)} ⁠ . Explicitly it is described as follows: Γ ( n ) = { ( a b c d ) ∈ S L 2 ( Z ) : a , d ≡ 1 ( mod n ) , b , c ≡ 0 ( mod n ) } {\displaystyle \Gamma (n)=\left\{{\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{pmatrix}}\in \mathrm {SL} _{2}(\mathbb {Z} ):a,d\equiv 1{\pmod {n}},\quad b,c\equiv 0{\pmod {n}}\right\}} This definition immediately implies that Γ ( n ) {\displaystyle \Gamma (n)} is a normal subgroup of finite index in ⁠ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } ⁠ . The strong approximation theorem (in this case an easy consequence of the Chinese remainder theorem ) implies that π n {\displaystyle \pi _{n}} is surjective, so that the quotient Γ / Γ ( n ) {\displaystyle \Gamma /\Gamma (n)} is isomorphic to ⁠ S L 2 ( Z / n Z ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {SL} _{2}(\mathbb {Z} /n\mathbb {Z} )} ⁠ . Computing the order of this finite group yields the following formula for the index: [ Γ : Γ ( n ) ] = n 3 ⋅ ∏ p ∣ n ( 1 − 1 p 2 ) {\displaystyle [\Gamma :\Gamma (n)]=n^{3}\cdot \prod _{p\mid n}\left(1-{\frac {1}{p^{2}}}\right)} where the product is taken over all prime numbers dividing ⁠ n {\displaystyle n} ⁠ . If n ⩾ 3 {\displaystyle n\geqslant 3} then the restriction of π n {\displaystyle \pi _{n}} to any finite subgroup of Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } is injective. This implies the following result: If n ⩾ 3 {\displaystyle n\geqslant 3} then the principal congruence subgroups Γ ( n ) {\displaystyle \Gamma (n)} are torsion-free. The group Γ ( 2 ) {\displaystyle \Gamma (2)} contains − Id {\displaystyle -\operatorname {Id} } and is not torsion-free. On the other hand, its image in PSL 2 ⁡ ( Z ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {PSL} _{2}(\mathbb {Z} )} is torsion-free, and the quotient of the hyperbolic plane by this subgroup is a sphere with three cusps. Definition of a congruence subgroup [ edit ] A subgroup H {\displaystyle H} in Γ = S L 2 ( Z ) {\displaystyle \Gamma =\mathrm {SL} _{2}(\mathbb {Z} )} is called a congruence subgroup if there exists n ⩾ 1 {\displaystyle n\geqslant 1} such that H {\displaystyle H} contains the principal congruence subgroup ⁠ Γ ( n ) {\displaystyle \Gamma (n)} ⁠ . The level l {\displaystyle l} of H {\displaystyle H} is then the smallest such ⁠ n {\displaystyle n} ⁠ . From this definition it follows that: Congruence subgroups are of finite index in ⁠ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } ⁠ ; The congruence subgroups of level ℓ {\displaystyle \ell } are in one-to-one correspondence with the subgroups of ⁠ SL 2 ⁡ ( Z / ℓ Z ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {SL} _{2}(\mathbb {Z} /\ell \mathbb {Z} )} ⁠ . Examples [ edit ] The subgroup ⁠ Γ 0 ( n ) {\displaystyle \Gamma _{0}(n)} ⁠ , sometimes called the Hecke congruence subgroup of level ⁠ n {\displaystyle n} ⁠ , is defined as the preimage by π n {\displaystyle \pi _{n}} of the group of upper triangular matrices. That is, Γ 0 ( n ) = { ( a b c d ) ∈ Γ : c ≡ 0 ( mod n ) } . {\displaystyle \Gamma _{0}(n)=\left\{{\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{pmatrix}}\in \Gamma :c\equiv 0{\pmod {n}}\right\}.} The index is given by the formula: [ Γ : Γ 0 ( n ) ] = n ⋅ ∏ p | n ( 1 + 1 p ) {\displaystyle [\Gamma :\Gamma _{0}(n)]=n\cdot \prod _{p|n}\left(1+{\frac {1}{p}}\right)} where the product is taken over all prime numbers dividing ⁠ n {\displaystyle n} ⁠ . If p {\displaystyle p} is prime then Γ / Γ 0 ( p ) {\displaystyle \Gamma /\Gamma _{0}(p)} is in natural bijection with the projective line over the finite field ⁠ F p {\displaystyle \mathbb {F} _{p}} ⁠ , and explicit representatives for the (left or right) cosets of Γ 0 ( p ) {\displaystyle \Gamma _{0}(p)} in Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } are the following matrices: Id , ( 1 0 1 1 ) , … , ( 1 0 p − 1 1 ) , ( 0 − 1 1 0 ) . {\displaystyle \operatorname {Id} ,{\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\1&1\end{pmatrix}},\ldots ,{\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\p-1&1\end{pmatrix}},{\begin{pmatrix}0&-1\\1&0\end{pmatrix}}.} The subgroups Γ 0 ( n ) {\displaystyle \Gamma _{0}(n)} are never torsion-free as they always contain the matrix ⁠ − I {\displaystyle -I} ⁠ . There are infinitely many n {\displaystyle n} such that the image of Γ 0 ( n ) {\displaystyle \Gamma _{0}(n)} in P S L 2 ( Z ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {PSL} _{2}(\mathbb {Z} )} also contains torsion elements. The subgroup Γ 1 ( n ) {\displaystyle \Gamma _{1}(n)} is the preimage of the subgroup of unipotent matrices: Γ 1 ( n ) = { ( a b c d ) ∈ Γ : a , d ≡ 1 ( mod n ) , c ≡ 0 ( mod n ) } . {\displaystyle \Gamma _{1}(n)=\left\{{\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{pmatrix}}\in \Gamma :a,d\equiv 1{\pmod {n}},c\equiv 0{\pmod {n}}\right\}.} Their indices are given by the formula: [ Γ : Γ 1 ( n ) ] = n 2 ⋅ ∏ p | n ( 1 − 1 p 2 ) {\displaystyle [\Gamma :\Gamma _{1}(n)]=n^{2}\cdot \prod _{p|n}\left(1-{\frac {1}{p^{2}}}\right)} The theta subgroup Λ {\displaystyle \Lambda } is the congruence subgroup of Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } defined as the preimage of the cyclic group of order two generated by ( 0 − 1 1 0 ) ∈ S L 2 ( Z / 2 Z ) {\displaystyle \left({\begin{smallmatrix}0&-1\\1&0\end{smallmatrix}}\right)\in \mathrm {SL} _{2}(\mathbb {Z} /2\mathbb {Z} )} . It is of index 3 and is explicitly described by: [2] Λ = { ( a b c d ) ∈ Γ : a c ≡ 0 ( mod 2 ) , b d ≡ 0 ( mod 2 ) } . {\displaystyle \Lambda =\left\{{\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{pmatrix}}\in \Gamma :ac\equiv 0{\pmod {2}},bd\equiv 0{\pmod {2}}\right\}.} These subgroups satisfy the following inclusions: ⁠ Γ ( n ) ⊂ Γ 1 ( n ) ⊂ Γ 0 ( n ) {\displaystyle \Gamma (n)\subset \Gamma _{1}(n)\subset \Gamma _{0}(n)} ⁠ , as well as ⁠ Γ ( 2 ) ⊂ Λ {\displaystyle \Gamma (2)\subset \Lambda } ⁠ . Properties of congruence subgroups [ edit ] The congruence subgroups of the modular group and the associated Riemann surfaces are distinguished by some particularly nice geometric and topological properties. Here is a sample: There are only finitely many congruence covers of the modular surface that have genus zero; [3] ( Selberg's 3/16 theorem ) If f {\displaystyle f} is a nonconstant eigenfunction of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a congruence cover of the modular surface with eigenvalue λ {\displaystyle \lambda } then ⁠ λ ⩾ 3 16 {\displaystyle \lambda \geqslant {\tfrac {3}{16}}} ⁠ . There is also a collection of distinguished operators called Hecke operators on smooth functions on congruence covers, which commute with each other and with the Laplace–Beltrami operator and are diagonalisable in each eigenspace of the latter. Their common eigenfunctions are a fundamental example of automorphic forms . Other automorphic forms associated to these congruence subgroups are the holomorphic modular forms, which can be interpreted as cohomology classes on the associated Riemann surfaces via the Eichler-Shimura isomorphism . Normalisers of Hecke congruence subgroups [ edit ] The normalizer Γ 0 ( p ) + {\displaystyle \Gamma _{0}(p)^{+}} of Γ 0 ( p ) {\displaystyle \Gamma _{0}(p)} in S L 2 ( R ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {SL} _{2}(\mathbb {R} )} has been investigated; one result from the 1970s, due to Jean-Pierre Serre , Andrew Ogg and John G. Thompson is that the corresponding modular curve (the Riemann surface resulting from taking the quotient of the hyperbolic plane by ⁠ Γ 0 ( p ) + {\displaystyle \Gamma _{0}(p)^{+}} ⁠ ) has genus zero (i.e., the modular curve is a Riemann sphere) if and only if ⁠ p {\displaystyle p} ⁠ is 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 41, 47, 59, or 71. When Ogg later heard about the monster group , he noticed that these were precisely the prime factors of the size of ⁠ M {\displaystyle M} ⁠ , he wrote up a paper offering a bottle of Jack Daniel's whiskey to anyone who could explain this fact – this was a starting point for the theory of monstrous moonshine , which explains deep connections between modular function theory and the monster group. In arithmetic groups [ edit ] Arithmetic groups [ edit ] Main article: Arithmetic group The notion of an arithmetic group is a vast generalisation based upon the fundamental example of ⁠ S L d ( Z ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {SL} _{d}(\mathbb {Z} )} ⁠ . In general, to give a definition one needs a semisimple algebraic group G {\displaystyle \mathbf {G} } defined over Q {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} } and a faithful representation ⁠ ρ {\displaystyle \rho } ⁠ , also defined over ⁠ Q {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} } ⁠ , from G {\displaystyle \mathbf {G} } into ⁠ G L d {\displaystyle \mathrm {GL} _{d}} ⁠ ; then an arithmetic group in G ( Q ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {G} (\mathbb {Q} )} is any group Γ ⊂ G ( Q ) {\displaystyle \Gamma \subset \mathbf {G} (\mathbb {Q} )} that is of finite index in the stabiliser of a finite-index sub-lattice in ⁠ Z d {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} ^{d}} ⁠ . Congruence subgroups [ edit ] Let Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } be an arithmetic group: for simplicity it is better to suppose that ⁠ Γ ⊂ G L n ( Z ) {\displaystyle \Gamma \subset \mathrm {GL} _{n}(\mathbb {Z} )} ⁠ . As in the case of S L 2 ( Z ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {SL} _{2}(\mathbb {Z} )} there are reduction morphisms ⁠ π n : Γ → G L d ( Z / n Z ) {\displaystyle \pi _{n}:\Gamma \to \mathrm {GL} _{d}(\mathbb {Z} /n\mathbb {Z} )} ⁠ . We can define a principal congruence subgroup of Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } to be the kernel of π n {\displaystyle \pi _{n}} (which may a priori depend on the representation ⁠ ρ {\displaystyle \rho } ⁠ ), and a congruence subgroup of Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } to be any subgroup that contains a principal congruence subgroup (a notion that does not depend on a representation). They are subgroups of finite index that correspond to the subgroups of the finite groups ⁠ π n ( Γ ) {\displaystyle \pi _{n}(\Gamma )} ⁠ , and the level is defined. Examples [ edit ] The principal congruence subgroups of S L d ( Z ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {SL} _{d}(\mathbb {Z} )} are the subgroups Γ ( n ) {\displaystyle \Gamma (n)} given by: Γ ( n ) = { ( a i j ) ∈ S L d ( Z ) : ∀ i a i i ≡ 1 ( mod n ) , ∀ i ≠ j a i j ≡ 0 ( mod n ) } {\displaystyle \Gamma (n)=\left\{(a_{ij})\in \mathrm {SL} _{d}(\mathbb {Z} ):\forall i\,a_{ii}\equiv 1{\pmod {n}},\,\forall i\neq j\,a_{ij}\equiv 0{\pmod {n}}\right\}} the congruence subgroups then correspond to the subgroups of S L d ( Z / n Z ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {SL} _{d}(\mathbb {Z} /n\mathbb {Z} )} . Another example of arithmetic group is given by the groups S L 2 ( O ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {SL} _{2}(O)} where O {\displaystyle O} is the ring of integers in a number field , for example ⁠ O = Z [ 2 ] {\displaystyle O=\mathbb {Z} [{\sqrt {2}}]} ⁠ . Then if p {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {p}}} is a prime ideal dividing a rational prime p {\displaystyle p} the subgroups Γ ( p ) {\displaystyle \Gamma ({\mathfrak {p}})} that is the kernel of the reduction map mod p {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {p}}} is a congruence subgroup since it contains the principal congruence subgroup defined by reduction modulo ⁠ p {\displaystyle p} ⁠ . Yet another arithmetic group is the Siegel modular groups ⁠ S p 2 g ( Z ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {Sp} _{2g}(\mathbb {Z} )} ⁠ , defined by: S p 2 g ( Z ) = { γ ∈ G L 2 g ( Z ) : γ T ( 0 I g − I g 0 ) γ = ( 0 I g − I g 0 ) } . {\displaystyle \mathrm {Sp} _{2g}(\mathbb {Z} )=\left\{\gamma \in \mathrm {GL} _{2g}(\mathbb {Z} ):\ \gamma ^{\mathrm {T} }{\begin{pmatrix}0&I_{g}\\-I_{g}&0\end{pmatrix}}\gamma ={\begin{pmatrix}0&I_{g}\\-I_{g}&0\end{pmatrix}}\right\}.} Note that if g = 1 {\displaystyle g=1} then ⁠ S p 2 ( Z ) = S L 2 ( Z ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {Sp} _{2}(\mathbb {Z} )=\mathrm {SL} _{2}(\mathbb {Z} )} ⁠ . The theta subgroup Γ ϑ ( n ) {\displaystyle \Gamma _{\vartheta }^{(n)}} of S p 2 g ( Z ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {Sp} _{2g}(\mathbb {Z} )} is the set of all ( A B C D ) ∈ S p 2 g ( Z ) {\displaystyle \left({\begin{smallmatrix}A&B\\C&D\end{smallmatrix}}\right)\in \mathrm {Sp} _{2g}(\mathbb {Z} )} such that both A B ⊤ {\displaystyle AB^{\top }} and C D ⊤ {\displaystyle CD^{\top }} have even diagonal entries. [4] Property (τ) [ edit ] The family of congruence subgroups in a given arithmetic group Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } always has property (τ) of Lubotzky–Zimmer. [5] This can be taken to mean that the Cheeger constant of the family of their Schreier coset graphs (with respect to a fixed generating set for ⁠ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } ⁠ ) is uniformly bounded away from zero, in other words they are a family of expander graphs . There is also a representation-theoretical interpretation: if Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } is a lattice in a Lie group ⁠ G {\displaystyle G} ⁠ then property (τ) is equivalent to the non-trivial unitary representations of ⁠ G {\displaystyle G} ⁠ occurring in the spaces L 2 ( G / Γ ) {\displaystyle L^{2}(G/\Gamma )} being bounded away from the trivial representation (in the Fell topology on the unitary dual of ⁠ G {\displaystyle G} ⁠ ). Property (τ) is a weakening of Kazhdan's property (T) which implies that the family of all finite-index subgroups has property (τ). In S -arithmetic groups [ edit ] If G {\displaystyle \mathbf {G} } is a Q {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} } -group and S = { p 1 , … , p r } {\displaystyle S=\{p_{1},\ldots ,p_{r}\}} is a finite set of primes, an S {\displaystyle S} -arithmetic subgroup of G ( Q ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {G} (\mathbb {Q} )} is defined as an arithmetic subgroup but using Z [ 1 / p 1 , … , 1 / p r ] ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} [1/p_{1},\ldots ,1/p_{r}])} instead of ⁠ Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } ⁠ . The fundamental example is ⁠ SL d ⁡ ( Z [ 1 / p 1 , … , 1 / p r ] ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {SL} _{d}(\mathbb {Z} [1/p_{1},\ldots ,1/p_{r}])} ⁠ . Let Γ S {\displaystyle \Gamma _{S}} be an S {\displaystyle S} -arithmetic group in an algebraic group ⁠ G ⊂ GL d {\displaystyle \mathbf {G} \subset \operatorname {GL} _{d}} ⁠ . If n {\displaystyle n} is an integer not divisible by any prime in ⁠ S {\displaystyle S} ⁠ , then all primes p i {\displaystyle p_{i}} are invertible modulo n {\displaystyle n} and it follows that there is a morphism ⁠ π n : Γ S → G L d ( Z / n Z ) {\displaystyle \pi _{n}:\Gamma _{S}\to \mathrm {GL} _{d}(\mathbb {Z} /n\mathbb {Z} )} ⁠ . Thus it is possible to define congruence subgroups in ⁠ Γ S {\displaystyle \Gamma _{S}} ⁠ , whose level is always coprime to all primes in ⁠ S {\displaystyle S} ⁠ . The congruence subgroup problem [ edit ] Finite-index subgroups in SL 2 (Z) [ edit ] Congruence subgroups in Γ = S L 2 ( Z ) {\displaystyle \Gamma =\mathrm {SL} _{2}(\mathbb {Z} )} are finite-index subgroups: it is natural to ask whether they account for all finite-index subgroups in ⁠ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } ⁠ . The answer is a resounding ""no"". This fact was already known to Felix Klein and there are many ways to exhibit many non-congruence finite-index subgroups. For example: The simple group in the composition series of a quotient ⁠ Γ / Γ ′ {\displaystyle \Gamma /\Gamma '} ⁠ , where Γ ′ {\displaystyle \Gamma '} is a normal congruence subgroup, must be a simple group of Lie type (or cyclic), in fact one of the groups S L 2 ( F p ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {SL} _{2}(\mathbb {F} _{p})} for a prime ⁠ p {\displaystyle p} ⁠ . But for every m {\displaystyle m} there are finite-index subgroups Γ ′ ⊂ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma '\subset \Gamma } such that Γ / Γ ′ {\displaystyle \Gamma /\Gamma '} is isomorphic to the alternating group A m {\displaystyle A_{m}} (for example Γ ( 2 ) {\displaystyle \Gamma (2)} surjects on any group with two generators, in particular on all alternating groups, and the kernels of these morphisms give an example). These groups thus must be non-congruence. There is a surjection ⁠ Γ ( 2 ) → Z {\displaystyle \Gamma (2)\to \mathbb {Z} } ⁠ ; for m {\displaystyle m} large enough the kernel of Γ ( 2 ) → Z → Z / m Z {\displaystyle \Gamma (2)\to \mathbb {Z} \to \mathbb {Z} /m\mathbb {Z} } must be non-congruence (one way to see this is that the Cheeger constant of the Schreier graph goes to 0; there is also a simple algebraic proof in the spirit of the previous item). The number c N {\displaystyle c_{N}} of congruence subgroups in Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } of index N {\displaystyle N} satisfies ⁠ log ⁡ c N = O ( ( log ⁡ N ) 2 / log ⁡ log ⁡ N ) {\displaystyle \log c_{N}=O\left((\log N)^{2}/\log \log N\right)} ⁠ . On the other hand, the number a N {\displaystyle a_{N}} of finite index subgroups of index N {\displaystyle N} in Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } satisfies ⁠ N log ⁡ N = O ( log ⁡ a N ) {\displaystyle N\log N=O(\log a_{N})} ⁠ , so most subgroups of finite index must be non-congruence. [6] Congruence kernel [ edit ] One can ask the same question for any arithmetic group as for the modular group: Naïve congruence subgroup problem: Given an arithmetic group, are all of its finite-index subgroups congruence subgroups? This problem can have a positive solution: its origin is in the work of Hyman Bass , Jean-Pierre Serre and John Milnor , and Jens Mennicke who proved that, in contrast to the case of S L 2 ( Z ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {SL} _{2}(\mathbb {Z} )} , when n ⩾ 3 {\displaystyle n\geqslant 3} all finite-index subgroups in S L n ( Z ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {SL} _{n}(\mathbb {Z} )} are congruence subgroups. The solution by Bass–Milnor–Serre involved an aspect of algebraic number theory linked to K-theory . [7] On the other hand, the work of Serre on S L 2 {\displaystyle \mathrm {SL} _{2}} over number fields shows that in some cases the answer to the naïve question is ""no"" while a slight relaxation of the problem has a positive answer. [8] This new problem is better stated in terms of certain compact topological groups associated to an arithmetic group ⁠ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } ⁠ . There is a topology on Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } for which a base of neighbourhoods of the trivial subgroup is the set of subgroups of finite index (the profinite topology ); and there is another topology defined in the same way using only congruence subgroups. The profinite topology gives rise to a completion ⁠ Γ ^ {\displaystyle {\widehat {\Gamma }}} ⁠ of ⁠ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } ⁠ , while the ""congruence"" topology gives rise to another completion ⁠ Γ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {\Gamma }}} ⁠ . Both are profinite groups and there is a natural surjective morphism Γ ^ → Γ ¯ {\displaystyle {\widehat {\Gamma }}\to {\overline {\Gamma }}} (intuitively, there are fewer conditions for a Cauchy sequence to comply with in the congruence topology than in the profinite topology). [9] [10] The congruence kernel C ( Γ ) {\displaystyle C(\Gamma )} is the kernel of this morphism, and the congruence subgroup problem stated above amounts to whether C ( Γ ) {\displaystyle C(\Gamma )} is trivial. The weakening of the conclusion then leads to the following problem. Congruence subgroup problem: Is the congruence kernel C ( Γ ) {\displaystyle C(\Gamma )} finite? When the problem has a positive solution one says that Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } has the congruence subgroup property . A conjecture generally attributed to Serre states that an irreducible arithmetic lattice in a semisimple Lie group G {\displaystyle G} has the congruence subgroup property if and only if the real rank of G {\displaystyle G} is at least 2; for example, lattices in S L 3 ( R ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {SL} _{3}(\mathbb {R} )} should always have the property. Negative solutions [ edit ] Serre's conjecture states that a lattice in a Lie group of rank one should not have the congruence subgroup property. There are three families of such groups: the orthogonal groups ⁠ S O ( d , 1 ) , d ⩾ 2 {\displaystyle \mathrm {SO} (d,1),d\geqslant 2} ⁠ , the unitary groups S U ( d , 1 ) , d ⩾ 2 {\displaystyle \mathrm {SU} (d,1),d\geqslant 2} and the groups S p ( d , 1 ) , d ⩾ 2 {\displaystyle \mathrm {Sp} (d,1),d\geqslant 2} (the isometry groups of a sesquilinear form over the Hamilton quaternions), plus the exceptional group F 4 − 20 {\displaystyle F_{4}^{-20}} (see List of simple Lie groups ). The current status of the congruence subgroup problem is as follows: It is known to have a negative solution (confirming the conjecture) for all groups S O ( d , 1 ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {SO} (d,1)} with ⁠ d ≠ 7 {\displaystyle d\neq 7} ⁠ . The proof uses the same argument as 2. in the case of S L 2 ( Z ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {SL} _{2}(\mathbb {Z} )} : in the general case it is much harder to construct a surjection to ⁠ Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } ⁠ , the proof is not at all uniform for all cases and fails for some lattices in dimension 7 due to the phenomenon of triality . [11] [12] In dimensions 2 and 3 and for some lattices in higher dimensions argument 1 and 3 also apply. It is known for many lattices in S U ( d , 1 ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {SU} (d,1)} , but not all (again using a generalisation of argument 2). [13] It is completely open in all remaining cases. Positive solutions [ edit ] In many situations where the congruence subgroup problem is expected to have a positive solution it has been proven that this is indeed the case. Here is a list of algebraic groups such that the congruence subgroup property is known to hold for the associated arithmetic lattices, in case the rank of the associated Lie group (or more generally the sum of the rank of the real and ⁠ p {\displaystyle p} ⁠ -adic factors in the case of ⁠ S {\displaystyle S} ⁠ -arithmetic groups) is at least 2: [14] Any non-anisotropic group (this includes the cases dealt with by Bass–Milnor–Serre, as well as S O ( p , q ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {SO} (p,q)} is ⁠ min ( p , q ) > 1 {\displaystyle \min(p,q)>1} ⁠ , and many others); Any group of type not A n {\displaystyle A_{n}} (for example all anisotropic forms of symplectic or orthogonal groups of real rank ⁠ ⩾ 2 {\displaystyle \geqslant 2} ⁠ ); Unitary groups of hermitian forms. The cases of inner and outer forms of type A n {\displaystyle A_{n}} are still open. The algebraic groups in the case of inner forms of type A n {\displaystyle A_{n}} are those associated to the unit groups in central simple division algebras; for example the congruence subgroup property is not known for lattices in S L 3 ( R ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {SL} _{3}(\mathbb {R} )} or S L 2 ( R ) × S L 2 ( R ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {SL} _{2}(\mathbb {R} )\times \mathrm {SL} _{2}(\mathbb {R} )} with compact quotient. [15] Congruence groups and adèle groups [ edit ] The ring of adeles A {\displaystyle \mathbb {A} } is the restricted product of all completions of ⁠ Q {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} } ⁠ , i.e. A = R × ∏ p ′ Q p {\displaystyle \mathbb {A} =\mathbb {R} \times \prod _{p}'\mathbb {Q} _{p}} where the product is over the set P {\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}} of all primes, Q p {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} _{p}} is the field of p -adic numbers and an element ( x , ( x p ) p ∈ P ) {\displaystyle (x,(x_{p})_{p\in {\mathcal {P}}})} belongs to the restricted product if and only if for almost all primes ⁠ p {\displaystyle p} ⁠ , x p {\displaystyle x_{p}} belongs to the subring Z p {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} _{p}} of p -adic integers . Given any algebraic group G {\displaystyle \mathbf {G} } over Q {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} } the adelic algebraic group G ( A ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {G} (\mathbb {A} )} is well-defined. It can be endowed with a canonical topology, which in the case where G {\displaystyle \mathbf {G} } is a linear algebraic group is the topology as a subset of ⁠ A m {\displaystyle \mathbb {A} ^{m}} ⁠ . The finite adèles A f {\displaystyle \mathbb {A} _{f}} are the restricted product of all non-archimedean completions (all p -adic fields). If Γ ⊂ G ( Q ) {\displaystyle \Gamma \subset \mathbf {G} (\mathbb {Q} )} is an arithmetic group then its congruence subgroups are characterised by the following property: H ⊂ Γ {\displaystyle H\subset \Gamma } is a congruence subgroup if and only if its closure H ¯ ⊂ G ( A f ) {\displaystyle {\overline {H}}\subset \mathbf {G} (\mathbb {A} _{f})} is a compact-open subgroup (compactness is automatic) and ⁠ H = Γ ∩ H ¯ {\displaystyle H=\Gamma \cap {\overline {H}}} ⁠ . In general the group Γ ∩ H ¯ {\displaystyle \Gamma \cap {\overline {H}}} is equal to the congruence closure of H {\displaystyle H} in ⁠ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } ⁠ , and the congruence topology on Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } is the induced topology as a subgroup of ⁠ G ( A f ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {G} (\mathbb {A} _{f})} ⁠ , in particular the congruence completion Γ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {\Gamma }}} is its closure in that group. These remarks are also valid for ⁠ S {\displaystyle S} ⁠ -arithmetic subgroups, replacing the ring of finite adèles with the restricted product over all primes not in ⁠ S {\displaystyle S} ⁠ . More generally one can define what it means for a subgroup Γ ⊂ G ( Q ) {\displaystyle \Gamma \subset \mathbf {G} (\mathbb {Q} )} to be a congruence subgroup without explicit reference to a fixed arithmetic subgroup, by asking that it be equal to its congruence closure ⁠ Γ ¯ ∩ G ( Q ) {\displaystyle {\overline {\Gamma }}\cap \mathbf {G} (\mathbb {Q} )} ⁠ . Thus it becomes possible to study all congruence subgroups at once by looking at the discrete subgroup ⁠ G ( Q ) ⊂ G ( A ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {G} (\mathbb {Q} )\subset \mathbf {G} (\mathbb {A} )} ⁠ . This is especially convenient in the theory of automorphic forms: for example all modern treatments of the Arthur–Selberg trace formula are done in this adélic setting.

In mathematics, the Hecke algebra of a pair ( G , K ) of locally compact or reductive Lie groups is an algebra of measures under convolution . It can also be defined for a pair ( g , K ) of a maximal compact subgroup K of a Lie group with Lie algebra g , in which case the Hecke algebra is an algebra with an approximate identity , whose approximately unital modules are the same as K -finite representations of the pairs ( g , K ). The Hecke algebra of a pair is a generalization of the classical Hecke algebra studied by Erich Hecke , which corresponds to the case (GL 2 ( Q ), GL 2 ( Z )). Locally compact groups [ edit ] Let ( G , K ) be a pair consisting of a unimodular locally compact topological group G and a closed subgroup K of G . Then the space of bi- K -invariant continuous functions of compact support C c ∞ [ K \ G / K ] can be endowed with a structure of an associative algebra under the operation of convolution . [1] This algebra is often denoted H ( G // K ) and called the Hecke algebra of the pair ( G , K ). Properties [ edit ] If ( G , K ) is a Gelfand pair then the Hecke algebra turns out to be commutative. Reductive Lie groups and Lie algebras [ edit ] In 1979, Daniel Flath gave a similar construction for general reductive Lie groups G . [2] The Hecke algebra of a pair ( g , K ) of a Lie algebra g with Lie group G and maximal compact subgroup K is the algebra of K -finite distributions on G with support in K , with the product given by convolution . [3] [4] Examples [ edit ] Finite groups [ edit ] Main article: Hecke algebra of a finite group When G is a finite group and K is any subgroup of G , then the Hecke algebra is spanned by double cosets of H \ G / H . SL( n ) over a p -adic field [ edit ] For the special linear group over the p -adic numbers , G = SL n ( Q p ) and K = SL n ( Z p ), the representations of the corresponding commutative Hecke ring were studied by Ian G. Macdonald . GL(2) over the rationals [ edit ] Main article: Hecke algebra For the general linear group over the rational numbers , G = GL 2 ( Q ) and K = GL 2 ( Z ) the Hecke algebra of the pair ( G , K is the classical Hecke algebra , which is the commutative ring of Hecke operators in the theory of modular forms . Iwahori [ edit ] Main article: Iwahori–Hecke algebra The case leading to the Iwahori–Hecke algebra of a finite Weyl group is when G is the finite Chevalley group over a finite field with p k elements, and B is its Borel subgroup . Iwahori showed that the Hecke ring H ( G // B ) is obtained from the generic Hecke algebra H q of the Weyl group W of G by specializing the indeterminate q of the latter algebra to p k , the cardinality of the finite field. George Lusztig remarked in 1984: [5] I think it would be most appropriate to call it the Iwahori algebra, but the name Hecke ring (or algebra) given by Iwahori himself has been in use for almost 20 years and it is probably too late to change it now. Iwahori and Matsumoto (1965) considered the case when G is a group of points of a reductive algebraic group over a non-archimedean local field F , such as Q p , and K is what is now called an Iwahori subgroup of G . The resulting Hecke ring is isomorphic to the Hecke algebra of the affine Weyl group of G , or the affine Hecke algebra , where the indeterminate q has been specialized to the cardinality of the residue field of F .

( May 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The Hecke algebra of a finite group is the algebra spanned by the double cosets HgH of a subgroup H of a finite group G . It is a special case of a Hecke algebra of a locally compact group . Definition [ edit ] Let F be a field of characteristic zero, G a finite group and H a subgroup of G . Let F [ G ] {\displaystyle F[G]} denote the group algebra of G : the space of F -valued functions on G with the multiplication given by convolution. We write F [ G / H ] {\displaystyle F[G/H]} for the space of F -valued functions on G / H {\displaystyle G/H} . An ( F -valued) function on G / H determines and is determined by a function on G that is invariant under the right action of H . That is, there is the natural identification: F [ G / H ] = F [ G ] H . {\displaystyle F[G/H]=F[G]^{H}.} Similarly, there is the identification R := End G ⁡ ( F [ G / H ] ) = F [ G ] H × H {\displaystyle R:=\operatorname {End} _{G}(F[G/H])=F[G]^{H\times H}} given by sending a G -linear map f to the value of f evaluated at the characteristic function of H . For each double coset H g H {\displaystyle HgH} , let T g {\displaystyle T_{g}} denote the characteristic function of it. Then those T g {\displaystyle T_{g}} 's form a basis of R . Application in representation theory [ edit ] Let φ : G → G L ( V ) {\displaystyle \varphi :G\rightarrow GL(V)} be any finite-dimensional complex representation of a finite group G , the Hecke algebra H = End G ⁡ ( V ) {\displaystyle H=\operatorname {End} _{G}(V)} is the algebra of G - equivariant endomorphisms of V . For each irreducible representation W {\displaystyle W} of G , the action of H on V preserves W ~ {\displaystyle {\tilde {W}}} – the isotypic component of W {\displaystyle W} – and commutes with W {\displaystyle W} as a G action.

Biography [ edit ] Hecke was born in Buk , Province of Posen , German Empire (now Poznań , Poland ). [1] He obtained his doctorate in Göttingen under the supervision of David Hilbert . [2] Kurt Reidemeister and Heinrich Behnke were among his students. [2] In 1933 Hecke signed the Loyalty Oath of German Professors to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist State , but was later known as being opposed to the Nazis. [3] Hecke died in Copenhagen , Denmark . [4] André Weil , in the foreword to his text Basic Number Theory [5] says: ""To improve upon Hecke, in a treatment along classical lines of the theory of algebraic numbers, would be a futile and impossible task"", referring to Hecke's book ""Lectures on the Theory of Algebraic Numbers."" [6] Research [ edit ] His early work included establishing the functional equation for the Dedekind zeta function , with a proof based on theta functions . The method extended to the L-functions associated to a class of characters now known as Hecke characters or idele class characters ; such L-functions are now known as Hecke L-functions. He devoted most of his research to the theory of modular forms , creating the general theory of cusp forms ( holomorphic , for GL(2)), as it is now understood in the classical setting. Recognition [ edit ] He was a Plenary Speaker of the ICM in 1936 in Oslo.

The matrices A and − A are identified. The modular group acts on the upper-half of the complex plane by fractional linear transformations , and the name ""modular group"" comes from the relation to moduli spaces and not from modular arithmetic . Definition [ edit ] The modular group Γ is the group of linear fractional transformations of the upper half of the complex plane , which have the form z ↦ a z + b c z + d {\displaystyle z\mapsto {\frac {az+b}{cz+d}}} where a , b , c , d are integers, and ad − bc = 1 . The group operation is function composition . This group of transformations is isomorphic to the projective special linear group PSL(2, Z ) , which is the quotient of the 2-dimensional special linear group SL(2, Z ) over the integers by its center { I , − I } . In other words, PSL(2, Z ) consists of all matrices ( a b c d ) {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{pmatrix}}} where a , b , c , d are integers, ad − bc = 1 , and pairs of matrices A and − A are considered to be identical. The group operation is the usual multiplication of matrices . Some authors define the modular group to be PSL(2, Z ) , and still others define the modular group to be the larger group SL(2, Z ) . Some mathematical relations require the consideration of the group GL(2, Z ) of matrices with determinant plus or minus one. ( SL(2, Z ) is a subgroup of this group.) Similarly, PGL(2, Z ) is the quotient group GL(2, Z )/{ I , − I } . A 2 × 2 matrix with unit determinant is a symplectic matrix , and thus SL(2, Z ) = Sp(2, Z ) , the symplectic group of 2 × 2 matrices. Finding elements [ edit ] To find an explicit matrix ( a x b y ) {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}a&x\\b&y\end{pmatrix}}} in SL(2, Z ) , begin with two coprime integers a , b {\displaystyle a,b} , and solve the determinant equation a y − b x = 1. {\displaystyle ay-bx=1.} (Notice the determinant equation forces a , b {\displaystyle a,b} to be coprime since otherwise there would be a factor c > 1 {\displaystyle c>1} such that c a ′ = a {\displaystyle ca'=a} , c b ′ = b {\displaystyle cb'=b} , hence c ( a ′ y − b ′ x ) = 1 {\displaystyle c(a'y-b'x)=1} would have no integer solutions.) For example, if a = 7 , b = 6 {\displaystyle a=7,{\text{ }}b=6} then the determinant equation reads 7 y − 6 x = 1 {\displaystyle 7y-6x=1} then taking y = − 5 {\displaystyle y=-5} and x = − 6 {\displaystyle x=-6} gives − 35 − ( − 36 ) = 1 {\displaystyle -35-(-36)=1} , hence ( 7 − 6 6 − 5 ) {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}7&-6\\6&-5\end{pmatrix}}} is a matrix. Then, using the projection, these matrices define elements in PSL(2, Z ) . Number-theoretic properties [ edit ] The unit determinant of ( a b c d ) {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{pmatrix}}} implies that the fractions ⁠ a / b ⁠ , ⁠ a / c ⁠ , ⁠ c / d ⁠ , ⁠ b / d ⁠ are all irreducible, that is having no common factors (provided the denominators are non-zero, of course). More generally, if ⁠ p / q ⁠ is an irreducible fraction, then a p + b q c p + d q {\displaystyle {\frac {ap+bq}{cp+dq}}} is also irreducible (again, provided the denominator be non-zero). Any pair of irreducible fractions can be connected in this way; that is, for any pair ⁠ p / q ⁠ and ⁠ r / s ⁠ of irreducible fractions, there exist elements ( a b c d ) ∈ SL ⁡ ( 2 , Z ) {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{pmatrix}}\in \operatorname {SL} (2,\mathbb {Z} )} such that r = a p + b q and s = c p + d q . {\displaystyle r=ap+bq\quad {\mbox{ and }}\quad s=cp+dq.} Elements of the modular group provide a symmetry on the two-dimensional lattice . Let ω 1 and ω 2 be two complex numbers whose ratio is not real. Then the set of points Λ ( ω 1 , ω 2 ) = { m ω 1 + n ω 2 : m , n ∈ Z } {\displaystyle \Lambda (\omega _{1},\omega _{2})=\{m\omega _{1}+n\omega _{2}:m,n\in \mathbb {Z} \}} is a lattice of parallelograms on the plane. A different pair of vectors α 1 and α 2 will generate exactly the same lattice if and only if ( α 1 α 2 ) = ( a b c d ) ( ω 1 ω 2 ) {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}\alpha _{1}\\\alpha _{2}\end{pmatrix}}={\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}\omega _{1}\\\omega _{2}\end{pmatrix}}} for some matrix in GL(2, Z ) . It is for this reason that doubly periodic functions , such as elliptic functions , possess a modular group symmetry. The action of the modular group on the rational numbers can most easily be understood by envisioning a square grid, with grid point ( p , q ) corresponding to the fraction ⁠ p / q ⁠ (see Euclid's orchard ). An irreducible fraction is one that is visible from the origin; the action of the modular group on a fraction never takes a visible (irreducible) to a hidden (reducible) one, and vice versa. Note that any member of the modular group maps the projectively extended real line one-to-one to itself, and furthermore bijectively maps the projectively extended rational line (the rationals with infinity) to itself, the irrationals to the irrationals, the transcendental numbers to the transcendental numbers, the non-real numbers to the non-real numbers, the upper half-plane to the upper half-plane, et cetera. If ⁠ p n −1 / q n −1 ⁠ and ⁠ p n / q n ⁠ are two successive convergents of a continued fraction , then the matrix ( p n − 1 p n q n − 1 q n ) {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}p_{n-1}&p_{n}\\q_{n-1}&q_{n}\end{pmatrix}}} belongs to GL(2, Z ) . In particular, if bc − ad = 1 for positive integers a , b , c , d with a < b and c < d then ⁠ a / b ⁠ and ⁠ c / d ⁠ will be neighbours in the Farey sequence of order max( b , d ) . Important special cases of continued fraction convergents include the Fibonacci numbers and solutions to Pell's equation . In both cases, the numbers can be arranged to form a semigroup subset of the modular group. Group-theoretic properties [ edit ] Presentation [ edit ] The modular group can be shown to be generated by the two transformations S : z ↦ − 1 z T : z ↦ z + 1 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}S&:z\mapsto -{\frac {1}{z}}\\T&:z\mapsto z+1\end{aligned}}} so that every element in the modular group can be represented (in a non-unique way) by the composition of powers of S and T . Geometrically, S represents inversion in the unit circle followed by reflection with respect to the imaginary axis, while T represents a unit translation to the right. The generators S and T obey the relations S 2 = 1 and ( ST ) 3 = 1 . It can be shown [1] that these are a complete set of relations, so the modular group has the presentation : Γ ≅ ⟨ S , T ∣ S 2 = I , ( S T ) 3 = I ⟩ {\displaystyle \Gamma \cong \left\langle S,T\mid S^{2}=I,\left(ST\right)^{3}=I\right\rangle } This presentation describes the modular group as the rotational triangle group D(2, 3, ∞) (infinity as there is no relation on T ), and it thus maps onto all triangle groups (2, 3, n ) by adding the relation T n = 1 , which occurs for instance in the congruence subgroup Γ( n ) . Using the generators S and ST instead of S and T , this shows that the modular group is isomorphic to the free product of the cyclic groups C 2 and C 3 : Γ ≅ C 2 ∗ C 3 {\displaystyle \Gamma \cong C_{2}*C_{3}} The action of T : z ↦ z + 1 on H The action of S : z ↦ − ⁠ 1 / z ⁠ on H Braid group [ edit ] The braid group B 3 is the universal central extension of the modular group. The braid group B 3 is the universal central extension of the modular group, with these sitting as lattices inside the (topological) universal covering group SL 2 ( R ) → PSL 2 ( R ) . Further, the modular group has a trivial center, and thus the modular group is isomorphic to the quotient group of B 3 modulo its center ; equivalently, to the group of inner automorphisms of B 3 . The braid group B 3 in turn is isomorphic to the knot group of the trefoil knot . Quotients [ edit ] The quotients by congruence subgroups are of significant interest. Other important quotients are the (2, 3, n ) triangle groups, which correspond geometrically to descending to a cylinder, quotienting the x coordinate modulo n , as T n = ( z ↦ z + n ) . (2, 3, 5) is the group of icosahedral symmetry , and the (2, 3, 7) triangle group (and associated tiling) is the cover for all Hurwitz surfaces . Presenting as a matrix group [ edit ] The group SL 2 ( Z ) {\displaystyle {\text{SL}}_{2}(\mathbb {Z} )} can be generated by the two matrices [2] S = ( 0 − 1 1 0 ) , T = ( 1 1 0 1 ) {\displaystyle S={\begin{pmatrix}0&-1\\1&0\end{pmatrix}},{\text{ }}T={\begin{pmatrix}1&1\\0&1\end{pmatrix}}} since S 2 = − I 2 , ( S T ) 3 = ( 0 − 1 1 1 ) 3 = − I 2 {\displaystyle S^{2}=-I_{2},{\text{ }}(ST)^{3}={\begin{pmatrix}0&-1\\1&1\end{pmatrix}}^{3}=-I_{2}} The projection SL 2 ( Z ) → PSL 2 ( Z ) {\displaystyle {\text{SL}}_{2}(\mathbb {Z} )\to {\text{PSL}}_{2}(\mathbb {Z} )} turns these matrices into generators of PSL 2 ( Z ) {\displaystyle {\text{PSL}}_{2}(\mathbb {Z} )} , with relations similar to the group presentation. Relationship to hyperbolic geometry [ edit ] See also: PSL 2 ( R ) The modular group is important because it forms a subgroup of the group of isometries of the hyperbolic plane . If we consider the upper half-plane model H of hyperbolic plane geometry, then the group of all orientation-preserving isometries of H consists of all Möbius transformations of the form z ↦ a z + b c z + d {\displaystyle z\mapsto {\frac {az+b}{cz+d}}} where a , b , c , d are real numbers . In terms of projective coordinates , the group PSL(2, R ) acts on the upper half-plane H by projectivity: [ z , 1 ] ( a c b d ) = [ a z + b , c z + d ] ∼ [ a z + b c z + d , 1 ] . {\displaystyle [z,\ 1]{\begin{pmatrix}a&c\\b&d\end{pmatrix}}\,=\,[az+b,\ cz+d]\,\thicksim \,\left[{\frac {az+b}{cz+d}},\ 1\right].} This action is faithful . Since PSL(2, Z ) is a subgroup of PSL(2, R ) , the modular group is a subgroup of the group of orientation-preserving isometries of H . [3] Tessellation of the hyperbolic plane [ edit ] A typical fundamental domain for the action of Γ on the upper half-plane. The modular group Γ acts on H {\textstyle \mathbb {H} } as a discrete subgroup of PSL ⁡ ( 2 , R ) {\textstyle \operatorname {PSL} (2,\mathbb {R} )} , that is, for each z in H {\textstyle \mathbb {H} } we can find a neighbourhood of z which does not contain any other element of the orbit of z . This also means that we can construct fundamental domains , which (roughly) contain exactly one representative from the orbit of every z in H . (Care is needed on the boundary of the domain.) There are many ways of constructing a fundamental domain, but a common choice is the region R = { z ∈ H : | z | > 1 , | Re ⁡ ( z ) | < 1 2 } {\displaystyle R=\left\{z\in \mathbb {H} \colon \left|z\right|>1,\,\left|\operatorname {Re} (z)\right|<{\tfrac {1}{2}}\right\}} bounded by the vertical lines Re( z ) = ⁠ 1 / 2 ⁠ and Re( z ) = − ⁠ 1 / 2 ⁠ , and the circle | z | = 1 . This region is a hyperbolic triangle. It has vertices at ⁠ 1 / 2 ⁠ + i ⁠ √ 3 / 2 ⁠ and − ⁠ 1 / 2 ⁠ + i ⁠ √ 3 / 2 ⁠ , where the angle between its sides is ⁠ π / 3 ⁠ , and a third vertex at infinity, where the angle between its sides is 0. There is a strong connection between the modular group and elliptic curves . Each point z {\displaystyle z} in the upper half-plane gives an elliptic curve, namely the quotient of C {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} } by the lattice generated by 1 and z {\displaystyle z} . Two points in the upper half-plane give isomorphic elliptic curves if and only if they are related by a transformation in the modular group. Thus, the quotient of the upper half-plane by the action of the modular group is the so-called moduli space of elliptic curves: a space whose points describe isomorphism classes of elliptic curves. This is often visualized as the fundamental domain described above, with some points on its boundary identified. The modular group and its subgroups are also a source of interesting tilings of the hyperbolic plane. By transforming this fundamental domain in turn by each of the elements of the modular group, a regular tessellation of the hyperbolic plane by congruent hyperbolic triangles known as the V6.6.∞ Infinite-order triangular tiling is created. Note that each such triangle has one vertex either at infinity or on the real axis Im( z ) = 0 . This tiling can be extended to the Poincaré disk , where every hyperbolic triangle has one vertex on the boundary of the disk. The tiling of the Poincaré disk is given in a natural way by the J -invariant , which is invariant under the modular group, and attains every complex number once in each triangle of these regions. This tessellation can be refined slightly, dividing each region into two halves (conventionally colored black and white), by adding an orientation-reversing map; the colors then correspond to orientation of the domain. Adding in ( x , y ) ↦ (− x , y ) and taking the right half of the region R (where Re( z ) ≥ 0 ) yields the usual tessellation. This tessellation first appears in print in ( Klein & 1878/79a ), [4] where it is credited to Richard Dedekind , in reference to ( Dedekind 1877 ). [4] [5] Visualization of the map (2, 3, ∞) → (2, 3, 7) by morphing the associated tilings. [6] The map of groups (2, 3, ∞) → (2, 3, n ) (from modular group to triangle group) can be visualized in terms of this tiling (yielding a tiling on the modular curve), as depicted in the video at right.

There is a natural homomorphism SL(2, Z ) → SL(2, Z / N Z ) given by reducing the entries modulo N . This induces a homomorphism on the modular group PSL(2, Z ) → PSL(2, Z / N Z ) . The kernel of this homomorphism is called the principal congruence subgroup of level N , denoted Γ( N ) . We have the following short exact sequence : 1 → Γ ( N ) → Γ → PSL ⁡ ( 2 , Z / N Z ) → 1. {\displaystyle 1\to \Gamma (N)\to \Gamma \to \operatorname {PSL} (2,\mathbb {Z} /N\mathbb {Z} )\to 1.} Being the kernel of a homomorphism Γ( N ) is a normal subgroup of the modular group Γ . The group Γ( N ) is given as the set of all modular transformations z ↦ a z + b c z + d {\displaystyle z\mapsto {\frac {az+b}{cz+d}}} for which a ≡ d ≡ ±1 (mod N ) and b ≡ c ≡ 0 (mod N ) . It is easy to show that the trace of a matrix representing an element of Γ( N ) cannot be −1, 0, or 1, so these subgroups are torsion-free groups . (There are other torsion-free subgroups.) The principal congruence subgroup of level 2, Γ(2) , is also called the modular group Λ . Since PSL(2, Z /2 Z ) is isomorphic to S 3 , Λ is a subgroup of index 6. The group Λ consists of all modular transformations for which a and d are odd and b and c are even. Another important family of congruence subgroups are the modular group Γ 0 ( N ) defined as the set of all modular transformations for which c ≡ 0 (mod N ) , or equivalently, as the subgroup whose matrices become upper triangular upon reduction modulo N . Note that Γ( N ) is a subgroup of Γ 0 ( N ) . The modular curves associated with these groups are an aspect of monstrous moonshine – for a prime number p , the modular curve of the normalizer is genus zero if and only if p divides the order of the monster group , or equivalently, if p is a supersingular prime . Dyadic monoid [ edit ] One important subset of the modular group is the dyadic monoid , which is the monoid of all strings of the form ST k ST m ST n ... for positive integers k , m , n ,... . This monoid occurs naturally in the study of fractal curves , and describes the self-similarity symmetries of the Cantor function , Minkowski's question mark function , and the Koch snowflake , each being a special case of the general de Rham curve . The monoid also has higher-dimensional linear representations; for example, the N = 3 representation can be understood to describe the self-symmetry of the blancmange curve . Maps of the torus [ edit ] The group GL(2, Z ) is the linear maps preserving the standard lattice Z 2 , and SL(2, Z ) is the orientation-preserving maps preserving this lattice; they thus descend to self-homeomorphisms of the torus (SL mapping to orientation-preserving maps), and in fact map isomorphically to the (extended) mapping class group of the torus, meaning that every self-homeomorphism of the torus is isotopic to a map of this form. The algebraic properties of a matrix as an element of GL(2, Z ) correspond to the dynamics of the induced map of the torus. Hecke groups [ edit ] The modular group can be generalized to the Hecke groups , named for Erich Hecke , and defined as follows. [7] The Hecke group H q with q ≥ 3 , is the discrete group generated by z ↦ − 1 z z ↦ z + λ q , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}z&\mapsto -{\frac {1}{z}}\\z&\mapsto z+\lambda _{q},\end{aligned}}} where λ q = 2 cos ⁠ π / q ⁠ . For small values of q ≥ 3 , one has: λ 3 = 1 , λ 4 = 2 , λ 5 = 1 + 5 2 , λ 6 = 3 , λ 8 = 2 + 2 . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\lambda _{3}&=1,\\\lambda _{4}&={\sqrt {2}},\\\lambda _{5}&={\frac {1+{\sqrt {5}}}{2}},\\\lambda _{6}&={\sqrt {3}},\\\lambda _{8}&={\sqrt {2+{\sqrt {2}}}}.\end{aligned}}} The modular group Γ is isomorphic to H 3 and they share properties and applications – for example, just as one has the free product of cyclic groups Γ ≅ C 2 ∗ C 3 , {\displaystyle \Gamma \cong C_{2}*C_{3},} more generally one has H q ≅ C 2 ∗ C q , {\displaystyle H_{q}\cong C_{2}*C_{q},} which corresponds to the triangle group (2, q , ∞) . There is similarly a notion of principal congruence subgroups associated to principal ideals in Z [ λ ] . History [ edit ] The modular group and its subgroups were first studied in detail by Richard Dedekind and by Felix Klein as part of his Erlangen programme in the 1870s. However, the closely related elliptic functions were studied by Joseph Louis Lagrange in 1785, and further results on elliptic functions were published by Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi and Niels Henrik Abel in 1827.

History [ edit ] Mordell ( 1917 ) used Hecke operators on modular forms in a paper on the special cusp form of Ramanujan , ahead of the general theory given by Hecke ( 1937a,1937b ). Mordell proved that the Ramanujan tau function , expressing the coefficients of the Ramanujan form, Δ ( z ) = q ( ∏ n = 1 ∞ ( 1 − q n ) ) 24 = ∑ n = 1 ∞ τ ( n ) q n , q = e 2 π i z , {\displaystyle \Delta (z)=q\left(\prod _{n=1}^{\infty }(1-q^{n})\right)^{24}=\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }\tau (n)q^{n},\quad q=e^{2\pi iz},} is a multiplicative function : τ ( m n ) = τ ( m ) τ ( n ) for ( m , n ) = 1. {\displaystyle \tau (mn)=\tau (m)\tau (n)\quad {\text{ for }}(m,n)=1.} The idea goes back to earlier work of Adolf Hurwitz , who treated algebraic correspondences between modular curves which realise some individual Hecke operators. Mathematical description [ edit ] Hecke operators can be realized in a number of contexts. The simplest meaning is combinatorial, namely as taking for a given integer n some function f ( Λ ) defined on the lattices of fixed rank to ∑ f ( Λ ′ ) {\displaystyle \sum f(\Lambda ')} with the sum taken over all the Λ′ that are subgroups of Λ of index n . For example, with n=2 and two dimensions, there are three such Λ′ . Modular forms are particular kinds of functions of a lattice, subject to conditions making them analytic functions and homogeneous with respect to homotheties , as well as moderate growth at infinity; these conditions are preserved by the summation, and so Hecke operators preserve the space of modular forms of a given weight. Another way to express Hecke operators is by means of double cosets in the modular group . In the contemporary adelic approach, this translates to double cosets with respect to some compact subgroups. Explicit formula [ edit ] Let M m be the set of 2×2 integral matrices with determinant m and Γ = M 1 be the full modular group SL (2, Z ) . Given a modular form f ( z ) of weight k , the m th Hecke operator acts by the formula T m f ( z ) = m k − 1 ∑ ( a b c d ) ∈ Γ ∖ M m ( c z + d ) − k f ( a z + b c z + d ) , {\displaystyle T_{m}f(z)=m^{k-1}\sum _{\left({\begin{smallmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{smallmatrix}}\right)\in \Gamma \backslash M_{m}}(cz+d)^{-k}f\left({\frac {az+b}{cz+d}}\right),} where z is in the upper half-plane and the normalization constant m k −1 assures that the image of a form with integer Fourier coefficients has integer Fourier coefficients. This can be rewritten in the form T m f ( z ) = m k − 1 ∑ a , d > 0 , a d = m 1 d k ∑ b ( mod d ) f ( a z + b d ) , {\displaystyle T_{m}f(z)=m^{k-1}\sum _{a,d>0,ad=m}{\frac {1}{d^{k}}}\sum _{b{\pmod {d}}}f\left({\frac {az+b}{d}}\right),} which leads to the formula for the Fourier coefficients of T m ( f ( z )) = Σ b n q n in terms of the Fourier coefficients of f ( z ) = Σ a n q n : b n = ∑ r > 0 , r | ( m , n ) r k − 1 a m n / r 2 . {\displaystyle b_{n}=\sum _{r>0,r|(m,n)}r^{k-1}a_{mn/r^{2}}.} One can see from this explicit formula that Hecke operators with different indices commute and that if a 0 = 0 then b 0 = 0 , so the subspace S k of cusp forms of weight k is preserved by the Hecke operators. If a (non-zero) cusp form f is a simultaneous eigenform of all Hecke operators T m with eigenvalues λ m then a m = λ m a 1 and a 1 ≠ 0 . Hecke eigenforms are normalized so that a 1 = 1 , then T m f = a m f , a m a n = ∑ r > 0 , r | ( m , n ) r k − 1 a m n / r 2 , m , n ≥ 1. {\displaystyle T_{m}f=a_{m}f,\quad a_{m}a_{n}=\sum _{r>0,r|(m,n)}r^{k-1}a_{mn/r^{2}},\ m,n\geq 1.} Thus for normalized cuspidal Hecke eigenforms of integer weight, their Fourier coefficients coincide with their Hecke eigenvalues. Hecke algebras [ edit ] Main article: Hecke algebra Algebras of Hecke operators are called ""Hecke algebras"", and are commutative rings . In the classical elliptic modular form theory, the Hecke operators T n with n coprime to the level acting on the space of cusp forms of a given weight are self-adjoint with respect to the Petersson inner product . Therefore, the spectral theorem implies that there is a basis of modular forms that are eigenfunctions for these Hecke operators. Each of these basic forms possesses an Euler product . More precisely, its Mellin transform is the Dirichlet series that has Euler products with the local factor for each prime p is the inverse [ clarification needed ] of the Hecke polynomial , a quadratic polynomial in p − s . In the case treated by Mordell, the space of cusp forms of weight 12 with respect to the full modular group is one-dimensional. It follows that the Ramanujan form has an Euler product and establishes the multiplicativity of τ ( n ) . Other related mathematical rings are also called ""Hecke algebras"", although sometimes the link to Hecke operators is not entirely obvious. These algebras include certain quotients of the group algebras of braid groups . The presence of this commutative operator algebra plays a significant role in the harmonic analysis of modular forms and generalisations.

A name sometimes used for Hecke character is the German term Größencharakter (often written Grössencharakter, Grossencharacter, etc.). Definition using ideles [ edit ] A Hecke character is a character of the idele class group of a number field or global function field . It corresponds uniquely to a character of the idele group which is trivial on principal ideles , via composition with the projection map. This definition depends on the definition of a character, which varies slightly between authors: It may be defined as a homomorphism to the non-zero complex numbers (also called a ""quasicharacter""), or as a homomorphism to the unit circle in C (""unitary""). Any quasicharacter (of the idele class group) can be written uniquely as a unitary character times a real power of the norm, so there is no big difference between the two definitions. The conductor of a Hecke character χ is the largest ideal m such that χ is a Hecke character mod m . Here we say that χ is a Hecke character mod m if χ (considered as a character on the idele group) is trivial on the group of finite ideles whose every v-adic component lies in 1 + m O v . Definition using ideals [ edit ] The original definition of a Hecke character, going back to Hecke, was in terms of a character on fractional ideals . For a number field K , let m = m f m ∞ be a K - modulus , with m f , the ""finite part"", being an integral ideal of K and m ∞ , the ""infinite part"", being a (formal) product of real places of K . Let I m denote the group of fractional ideals of K relatively prime to m f and let P m denote the subgroup of principal fractional ideals ( a ) where a is near 1 at each place of m in accordance with the multiplicities of its factors: for each finite place v in m f , ord v ( a − 1) is at least as large as the exponent for v in m f , and a is positive under each real embedding in m ∞ . A Hecke character with modulus m is a group homomorphism from I m into the nonzero complex numbers such that on ideals ( a ) in P m its value is equal to the value at a of a continuous homomorphism to the nonzero complex numbers from the product of the multiplicative groups of all Archimedean completions of K where each local component of the homomorphism has the same real part (in the exponent). (Here we embed a into the product of Archimedean completions of K using embeddings corresponding to the various Archimedean places on K .) Thus a Hecke character may be defined on the ray class group modulo m , which is the quotient I m / P m . Strictly speaking, Hecke made the stipulation about behavior on principal ideals for those admitting a totally positive generator. So, in terms of the definition given above, he really only worked with moduli where all real places appeared. The role of the infinite part m ∞ is now subsumed under the notion of an infinity-type. Relationship between the definitions [ edit ] The ideal definition is much more complicated than the idelic one, and Hecke's motivation for his definition was to construct L -functions (sometimes referred to as Hecke L -functions ) [1] that extend the notion of a Dirichlet L -function from the rationals to other number fields. For a Hecke character χ, its L -function is defined to be the Dirichlet series ∑ ( I , m ) = 1 χ ( I ) N ( I ) − s = L ( s , χ ) {\displaystyle \sum _{(I,m)=1}\chi (I)N(I)^{-s}=L(s,\chi )} carried out over integral ideals relatively prime to the modulus m of the Hecke character. The notation N(I) means the ideal norm . The common real part condition governing the behavior of Hecke characters on the subgroups P m implies these Dirichlet series are absolutely convergent in some right half-plane. Hecke proved these L -functions have a meromorphic continuation to the whole complex plane, being analytic except for a simple pole of order 1 at s = 1 when the character is trivial. For primitive Hecke characters (defined relative to a modulus in a similar manner to primitive Dirichlet characters), Hecke showed these L -functions satisfy a functional equation relating the values of the L -function of a character and the L -function of its complex conjugate character. Consider a character ψ of the idele class group, taken to be a map into the unit circle which is 1 on principal ideles and on an exceptional finite set S containing all infinite places. Then ψ generates a character χ of the ideal group I S , the free abelian group on the prime ideals not in S . [2] Take a uniformising element π for each prime p not in S and define a map Π from I S to idele classes by mapping each p to the class of the idele which is π in the p coordinate and 1 everywhere else. Let χ be the composite of Π and ψ. Then χ is well-defined as a character on the ideal group. [3] In the opposite direction, given an admissible character χ of I S there corresponds a unique idele class character ψ. [4] Here admissible refers to the existence of a modulus m based on the set S such that the character χ is 1 on the ideals which are 1 mod m . [5] The characters are 'big' in the sense that the infinity-type when present non-trivially means these characters are not of finite order. The finite-order Hecke characters are all, in a sense, accounted for by class field theory : their L -functions are Artin L -functions , as Artin reciprocity shows. But even a field as simple as the Gaussian field has Hecke characters that go beyond finite order in a serious way (see the example below). Later developments in complex multiplication theory indicated that the proper place of the 'big' characters was to provide the Hasse–Weil L -functions for an important class of algebraic varieties (or even motives ). Special cases [ edit ] A Dirichlet character is a Hecke character of finite order. It is determined by values on the set of totally positive principal ideals which are 1 with respect to some modulus m . [5] A Hilbert character is a Dirichlet character of conductor 1. [5] The number of Hilbert characters is the order of the class group of the field. Class field theory identifies the Hilbert characters with the characters of the Galois group of the Hilbert class field. Examples [ edit ] For the field of rational numbers, the idele class group is isomorphic to the product of positive reals R + {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{+}} with all the unit groups of the p -adic integers. So a quasicharacter can be written as product of a power of the norm with a Dirichlet character. A Hecke character χ of the Gaussian integers of conductor 1 is of the form χ(( a )) = | a | s ( a /| a |) 4 n for s imaginary and n an integer, where a is a generator of the ideal ( a ). The only units are powers of i , so the factor of 4 in the exponent ensures that the character is well defined on ideals. Tate's thesis [ edit ] Main article: Tate's thesis Hecke's original proof of the functional equation for L ( s ,χ) used an explicit theta-function . John Tate 's 1950 Princeton doctoral dissertation, written under the supervision of Emil Artin , applied Pontryagin duality systematically, to remove the need for any special functions. A similar theory was independently developed by Kenkichi Iwasawa which was the subject of his 1950 ICM talk. A later reformulation in a Bourbaki seminar by Weil 1966 showed that parts of Tate's proof could be expressed by distribution theory : the space of distributions (for Schwartz–Bruhat test functions ) on the adele group of K transforming under the action of the ideles by a given χ has dimension 1. Algebraic Hecke characters [ edit ] An algebraic Hecke character is a Hecke character taking algebraic values: they were introduced by Weil in 1947 under the name type A 0 . Such characters occur in class field theory and the theory of complex multiplication . [6] Indeed let E be an elliptic curve defined over a number field F with complex multiplication by the imaginary quadratic field K , and suppose that K is contained in F . Then there is an algebraic Hecke character χ for F , with exceptional set S the set of primes of bad reduction of E together with the infinite places. This character has the property that for a prime ideal p of good reduction , the value χ( p ) is a root of the characteristic polynomial of the Frobenius endomorphism . As a consequence, the Hasse–Weil zeta function for E is a product of two Dirichlet series, for χ and its complex conjugate.

For information for readers, see Wikipedia:FAQ/Categories . For more detailed guidelines on creating and organizing categories, see Help:Category . More technical information can be found at Wikipedia:Categorization . What are categories? Categories allow articles to be placed in one or more groups, and allow those groups to be further categorized. An article belonging to a category should contain a link to a page that describes the category. Similarly, a sub-category belonging to a parent category should contain a link to the parent category's page. Each category page contains an introduction that can be edited like an article, and an automatically generated list of links to sub-categories and articles that belong to the category. Categories do not form a strict hierarchy or tree of categories, since each article can appear in more than one category, and each category can appear in more than one parent category. This allows multiple categorization schemes to co-exist. What is the purpose of categories? See meta:Categorization requirements for the original purpose of the feature. What categories already exist? The best way to find out what exists is to browse. Either start at Wikipedia:Browse or Category:Articles , which shows the ""top"" level categories, to which all other categories should be connected. A list of all categories can be found at Special:Categories – there are many listed but you can use the search box. Category:Wikipedia categories is the standard top-level category provided by the MediaWiki software, but orphan categories (categories without any parent categories) can exist. What is the difference between a list and a category? Grouping articles into a category is not the same as making a list of articles. To edit a list of articles, you edit the list directly; but to place articles into a category, you edit an article and insert a category tag by placing [[Category:<category name>]] in the body of the text. This adds those articles as a list on the category's page. While an article may be in multiple lists, the goal is that browsing downwards from a list parent category, e.g. Category:People , you should only arrive at articles that are about people, and not related articles. Further information on this topic can be found at Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and navigation templates . Are ""List of ..."" articles still needed? Lists are still useful for showing ""missing"" articles. What's the difference between categories and navigation templates? John Brown's Raid on Harpers Ferry has an article , a category , and a navigation template . A navigation template is a collection of links on a single topic, formatted in a standard way, in a box with a border. These links can be arranged in different ways within the box. The box is placed at the right or at the foot of the pages linked in it. There are fewer navigation templates than categories. There is no requirement that a page be linked in a navigation template, whereas every page must belong to at least one category, and almost always more. When appropriate, however, a navigation template organizes links in a far more useful way than categories do. It permits many nuances that categories can not, or can only clumsily. For the reader, a navigation template, if it exists, makes finding related articles much faster. Templates are more complicated to create than categories, and the Wikipedian wishing to create one may want to use an existing template as a model. Can pages be in more than one category? Yes, it is expected that most pages will be members of one category or more. Similarly, each category can be a member of more than one parent category. What are ""maintenance categories""? Some categories exist to aid maintenance of the project, for example, template categories and redirect categories. Maintenance categories are often added by templates rather than links. Contributors monitor these maintenance categories for many reasons to cleanup articles. Maintenance categories are usually ""hidden"" from view and can be seen only by registered users who have set their preferences to see hidden categories, which is easy to do: Go to Preferences → Appearance Scroll down to Advanced options Check the box Show hidden categories Click Save It is a good idea to purge your browser cache to ensure that you can see hidden categories after setting your preferences. Templates used to populate redirect categories are indexed functionally and alphanumerically at Wikipedia:Template messages/Redirect pages . What is the naming convention for categories? Use the Wikipedia titling conventions of no unnecessary capital letters or abbreviations, i.e. use [[Category:Category examples]] instead of [[Category:Category E.g.]]. If the category collects articles, then avoid the word List in the name of the category, and use plurals, e.g. Category:Popes . However, if the category collects lists , then using the word Lists in the name of the category is appropriate, e.g. Category:Lists of radio stations . Use the topic name without indicating structure, e.g. [[Category:History of London]] instead of [[Category:History - Europe - UK - London]]. For more on this, see Wikipedia:Naming conventions (categories) . How do I add an article to a category? Edit the article and add [[Category: Category name ]] at the bottom of the article. For example: [[Category:Mind-body interventions]]. How do I reference (link to) a category on a page without categorizing the page? To link to the category page, put a colon before the word ""category"", inside the link, e.g. [[: Category:United States ]], which will appear as Category:United States . Where should the category tag go in the article? Category tags should be placed at the bottom of the article, after the appendices (e.g. References and External links). This ensures that when an editor presses ""edit"", the editor is immediately presented with the main article text, rather than the more esoteric category tags. It also ensures that the category tags are in a consistent place so they are easy to find. In what order should categories be listed within the article? Both the alphabet and importance are used to order categories currently. Although this, like most ordering issues in Wikipedia, is a matter for judgment, it is generally clear that some categories – for example the birthplace or birth year of a person – are less important than others, such as their status as an Oscar or Nobel Prize winner. See also Wikipedia:Overcategorization . How do I sort the article differently on the category page? Use a {{ DEFAULTSORT }} tag, which looks like {{DEFAULTSORT:Smith, John}}. All categories will then sort under ""Smith"" unless a sorting key is used for them (see below). For individual categories, use a sorting key . For example, an article categorized by [[Category:Proper category|Sorting key]] would appear under S within the category. Which categories can be used for articles on people? Articles about people should be categorized cautiously. Unlike the body of the article, the various category choices for people can focus on, in most cases, what are common and unrelated attributes such as place of birth and gender, instead of emphasising the reason for their inclusion. See Wikipedia:Categorization of people for guidelines. Somebody changed my categorization – what do I do? All contributions to Wikipedia may be ""edited mercilessly"". If the change was not explained in the article history or talk page , try leaving a question on the relevant user's talk page. Remember to follow the bold, revert, discuss procedure. What should I do if I see an article without any categories? Try to categorize it yourself. If you are unable to, add the {{ Uncategorized }} template to the article, which will place a notice that the article needs categorizing, and automatically add it to the list at Category:Uncategorized pages . I am interested in a category – where can I get involved? If there is one, you can join the WikiProject involved. I want to change the relationships of some categories – will anyone mind? If you want to restructure some existing categories, it is best to discuss your plans with others working in the same areas, or at least to announce your intentions. How do I create a category? A category page should contain a brief description of the purpose of the category. A prominent link to the most important article in the category is usually a good idea, but please avoid copying large quantities of text or images from an article to a category page. In many cases, a category has a ""main article"", which describes the subject of that category. The category and the article often have the same name. In such case, do this: Add the ""{{cat main}}"" tag in the category. Arrange for the article to appear at the top of the list of articles in the category, by putting a vertical bar and a space after the category name in the Category: tag (e.g. [[Category:<category name>| ]]). If the subject has count, then make the category name plural and create a redirect of that same, plural name, redirecting back to the singular name. For instance City and Category:Cities . That is, create a page called ""Cities"" and add the line #REDIRECT [[City]] In theory, if a main article is categorized correctly in its corresponding category, the use of the cat main template is redundant. Do categories need parents? Yes. If you are creating a new category, look for a suitable ""parent"" category (or several) to assign it to. A good place to look is in articles on related subjects. If you do not have a parent category, then your category cannot be browsed to via other categories. Also, your category will show up on Wikipedia:Database reports/Uncategorized categories . Can categories be renamed, moved, or redirected? Shortcut WP:CMOVE Yes, ""speedy renaming"" can be done by listing the category at Wikipedia:Categories for discussion#Speedy renaming . See Wikipedia:Category deletion policy#Speedy renaming procedure . Redirects in the form #REDIRECT [[Category:New name]] are not recommended in category space. Instead, use the template {{ Category redirect }} : a bot periodically recategorizes articles in the redirected category to the target category. Any editor can add a category redirect although, in general, established categories should not be unilaterally redirected but should be taken to Wikipedia:Categories for discussion to suggest redirecting as part of a rename / merger of the category. Categories can be moved. The old page will have {{ Category redirect |New name}} instead of #REDIRECT [[:Category:New name]]. How do I delete a category? If you feel a category falls within Wikipedia:Category deletion policy , bring it up on Wikipedia:Categories for discussion . When were categories implemented? The category feature appeared in the MediaWiki software v1.3 , which was implemented on Wikipedia in late May 2004. Initially categories were displayed at the top right of articles, but they were soon moved to the bottom due to layout conflicts. Why might a category list not be up to date? Sometimes, pages are not placed in categories manually by Wikipedia editors, but by means of templates , which can be used to place identical information (including category membership information) on many different pages at once. When the information on such a template is edited, the pages containing that template are updated, but not necessarily updated immediately. This means that pages might not always appear in the most current categories. However, this problem usually affects project maintenance categories rather than the categories used for browsing. Various other delays sometimes mean that lists of category members or subcategories, or the page counts given, are not completely up to date (see Phabricator tickets T18036 , T132467 , and T157670 for technical details). So if you are editing Wikipedia and find that your page hasn't yet shown up in a category or been removed from an old category, don't panic! The problem may resolve itself within minutes, but sometimes it may take longer, in some cases days, even months. (It may help if you purge the page.) What tools are there to browse categories? PetScan is a powerful querying tool that, among other tasks, can scan categories, selecting pages on many categories.

Many of these items named after Euler include their own unique function, equation, formula, identity, number (single or sequence), or other mathematical entity. Many of these entities have been given simple and ambiguous names such as Euler's function , Euler's equation , and Euler's formula . Euler's work touched upon so many fields that he is often the earliest written reference on a given matter. In an effort to avoid naming everything after Euler, some discoveries and theorems are attributed to the first person to have proved them after Euler. [1] [2] Conjectures [ edit ] Euler's conjecture (Waring's problem) Euler's sum of powers conjecture Euler's Graeco-Latin square conjecture Equations [ edit ] Usually, Euler's equation refers to one of (or a set of) differential equations (DEs). It is customary to classify them into ODEs and PDEs . Otherwise, Euler's equation may refer to a non-differential equation, as in these three cases: Euler–Lotka equation , a characteristic equation employed in mathematical demography Euler's pump and turbine equation Euler transform used to accelerate the convergence of an alternating series and is also frequently applied to the hypergeometric series Ordinary differential equations [ edit ] Euler rotation equations , a set of first-order ODEs concerning the rotations of a rigid body . Euler–Cauchy equation , a linear equidimensional second-order ODE with variable coefficients . Its second-order version can emerge from Laplace's equation in polar coordinates . Euler–Bernoulli beam equation , a fourth-order ODE concerning the elasticity of structural beams. Euler's differential equation , a first order nonlinear ordinary differential equation Partial differential equations [ edit ] Euler conservation equations , a set of quasilinear first-order hyperbolic equations used in fluid dynamics for inviscid flows . In the (Froude) limit of no external field, they are conservation equations . Euler–Tricomi equation – a second-order PDE emerging from Euler conservation equations. Euler–Poisson–Darboux equation , a second-order PDE playing important role in solving the wave equation . Euler–Lagrange equation , a second-order PDE emerging from minimization problems in calculus of variations . Formulas [ edit ] Euler's formula , e ix = cos x + i sin x Euler's polyhedral formula for planar graphs or polyhedra: v − e + f = 2 , a special case of the Euler characteristic in topology Euler's formula for the critical load of a column: P cr = π 2 E I ( K L ) 2 {\displaystyle P_{\text{cr}}={\frac {\pi ^{2}EI}{(KL)^{2}}}} Euler's continued fraction formula connecting a finite sum of products with a finite continued fraction Euler product formula for the Riemann zeta function . Euler–Maclaurin formula ( Euler's summation formula ) relating integrals to sums Euler–Rodrigues formula describing the rotation of a vector in three dimensions Euler's reflection formula , reflection formula for the gamma function Local Euler characteristic formula Functions [ edit ] The Euler function , a modular form that is a prototypical q-series . Euler's totient function (or Euler phi (φ) function) in number theory , counting the number of coprime integers less than an integer. Euler hypergeometric integral Euler–Riemann zeta function Identities [ edit ] Euler's identity e i π + 1 = 0 . Euler's four-square identity , which shows that the product of two sums of four squares can itself be expressed as the sum of four squares.

J. Sylvester was known for his ability to coin new names and new notation for mathematical objects, [1] not based on his own name. Nevertheless, many objects and results in mathematics have come to be named after him: [2] The Sylvester–Gallai theorem , on the existence of a line with only two of n given points. [3] Sylvester–Gallai configuration , a set of points and lines without any two-point lines. Sylvester matroid , a matroid without any two-point lines. [4] Sylvester's determinant identity . Sylvester's matrix theorem, a.k.a. Sylvester's formula , for a matrix function in terms of eigenvalues. Sylvester's theorem on the product of k consecutive integers > k , that generalizes Bertrand's postulate . Sylvester's law of inertia a.k.a. Sylvester's rigidity theorem, about the signature of a quadratic form. Sylvester's identity about determinants of submatrices. [5] Sylvester's criterion , a characterization of positive-definite Hermitian matrices. Sylvester domain . The Sylvester matrix for two polynomials. Sylvester's sequence , where each term is the product of previous terms plus one. Sylvester cyclotomic numbers . The Sylvester equation , AX + XB = C where A , B , C are given matrices and X is an unknown matrix. Sylvester's ""four point problem"" of geometric probability. The Sylvester expansion or Fibonacci–Sylvester expansion of a rational number, a representation as a sum of unit fractions found by a greedy algorithm. Sylvester's rank inequality rank( A ) + rank( B ) − n ≤ rank( AB ) on the rank of the product of an m × n matrix A and an n × p matrix B . Sylver coinage , a number-theoretic game. [6] Other things named after Sylvester [ edit ] Sylvester (crater) , an impact crater on the Moon Sylvester Medal , given by the Royal Society for the encouragement of mathematical research [7] Sylvester (javascript library) , a vector, matrix and geometry library for JavaScript See also [ edit ] Sylvester's closed solution for the Frobenius coin problem when there are only two coins.

This page documents an English Wikipedia policy . It describes a widely accepted standard that all editors should normally follow. Changes made to it should reflect consensus . Shortcuts WP:U WP:UN WP:UPOL WP:USERNAME This page in a nutshell: When choosing an account name, do not choose names which may be offensive, misleading, disruptive, or promotional. The username should represent one person; do not use your organisation's name. To report blatant violations of the username policy, visit Wikipedia:Usernames for administrator attention (WP:UAA). Conduct policies Block evasion Civility Clean start Consensus Dispute resolution Edit warring Editing policy Harassment No personal attacks Ownership of content Sockpuppetry Username policy Vandalism v t e This policy describes what kinds of usernames are acceptable on the English Wikipedia and how unacceptable or doubtful usernames can be dealt with. It also specifies that a user account should be used only by one person, and that in most cases one person should use only one account. You choose your username when creating a user account . All contributions made using that account will then be attributed to the chosen username (contributions made while not logged in to any account are attributed to the user's IP address ). It is also possible to request a change of username , and have your past contributions re-attributed to the new name. This policy applies to usernames on English Wikipedia. However, in most cases you will be able to use the same username and password to log in to other language Wikipedias and other Wikimedia Foundation supported projects. See Wikipedia:Unified login . Introductory clip on usernames Guidance for new users English Wikipedia username policy summary Your username must represent you as an individual person Usernames are not allowed on Wikipedia if they: only contain the names of companies, organizations, websites, musical groups or bands, teams, clubs, creative groups, or organized events only describe a particular role, title, position, department, or a group or team of people within a parent organization or group that can be represented or held by multiple people or by different people are promotional in nature, or appear intended to advertise, promote, sell, gain support, or increase the attention or user-base audience of any person, company, market, product, channel, website, or other good or service imply that your user account will be shared between more than one person Your username must be truthful, appropriate, and not foster a negative editing environment Usernames are not allowed on Wikipedia and will be immediately blocked upon discovery if they: are offensive, profane, violent, threatening, sexually explicit, or disruptive, or that advocate or encourage any such behavior (including criminal or illegal acts) contain statements that are libelous, contentious, or disparaging, or that disclose any private or non-public information about somebody else (either another editor, or a notable living person) are deliberately deceptive, confusing, misleading, unnecessarily long, similar to the username of other accounts, or attempt to impersonate or falsely represent somebody else (another editor, a notable living person, an ""official"" Wikimedia Foundation account, etc.) in bad faith imply that the account has explicit ownership of any articles, content, or topic areas, or any kind of ""power"" or ""authority"" over other editors, a different application of Wikipedia's policies and guidelines (such as implying that certain policies do not apply to them), or that the account has any administrative or ""moderator"" access levels or user rights imply the intent to troll, vandalize , disrupt , advertise , or spam Wikipedia imply the intent to personally attack , harass , or threaten other Wikipedia users imply that you are not here to build an encyclopedia or will use Wikipedia for purposes that it was not created for Shortcut WP:NAMEGUIDE Your username is a nickname that will identify your account and thereby all of your contributions to Wikipedia. It can be your real name if you so choose, but you should be aware of the risks involved in editing under your real name before choosing to use or disclose your real name on Wikipedia. Wikipedia usernames are case sensitive , but the first letter is always automatically capitalized. By default, your username appears in your signature on posts to discussion pages . For further details on signatures and how to customize them, see Wikipedia:Signatures . You must keep in mind that, once chosen, a username cannot be easily changed, and changing your username doesn't hide your previous username from all of the edits that you've made while using it (such as the signature of your previous username that you left on any talk pages, messages, discussions, and replies). For example, if ""Dr. Franz Schröder"" is your real name, and you choose this to be your username, your real name and doctorate will be evident on your edits, on history pages, and (unless you change your signature) on all posts, messages, and replies that you make to talk pages and discussions. It is highly recommended that you read and understand the section on using your real name as your username before you decide to do so. Likewise, reusing a name here which you also use on other sites may be as revealing as using your actual name. You will be required to specify the username that you'd like to use when you are creating a new account , and you will subsequently use it (together with your password) to log in to that account. Once you have an account, you may create a user page , titled ""User:XXXX"" (where ""XXXX"" is your username), to provide relevant information about yourself to other Wikipedians. You or any other editor may also create a user talk page , titled ""User talk:XXXX"", that people can use to contact you. The MediaWiki software will not allow you to register a new account with a username that is already taken by another account, nor will it allow you to register a username that is too similar to another account. You can check whether or not a username is already taken; if the username is not listed when you enter it into the username search, it means that the provided username is not taken. Please note that the page does not return usernames that are too similar; it only returns a match if the exact username you enter is already taken. You may still be able to obtain a username that is too similar to another account under certain circumstances; see § Similar usernames below. Your username can be virtually any string of characters (subject to a few technical limitations ). However, it should be a name which other users will be comfortable with and which does not interfere with the project. A controversial name may give a bad impression to other users, and avoiding this is in your own interest. This page describes certain types of usernames that are specifically disallowed, primarily because they can be considered offensive , misleading , or promotional , or imply that the account does not belong to an individual . Inappropriate usernames Shortcut WP:IU This section lists the types of usernames that are considered inappropriate. The same criteria also apply to signatures . These lists are not necessarily exhaustive. Use common sense in applying these rules; a username containing a word that may seem offensive in one context may have a very different, more benign meaning in another. For guidance on how to deal with inappropriate usernames if encountered, see § Dealing with inappropriate usernames below. Disruptive or offensive usernames Shortcuts WP:ATTACKNAME WP:DISRUPTNAME The following types of usernames are not permitted, and will be immediately blocked upon discovery , because they are disruptive or offensive : Usernames that are likely to offend other contributors or cause disruption to productive Wikipedia processes or discussions, or make harmonious editing difficult or impossible to achieve; e.g. by containing profanities, or referencing highly contentious events or controversies. [1] Usernames that are blatantly profane, violent, threatening, or sexually explicit, or that advocate or encourage any such behavior (including acts that are deemed by most societies as either extremely immoral, criminal, or illegal). Usernames that deliberately offend, dehumanize, attack, demean, disparage, discriminate, or support or advocate any such behavior toward any race, religion, gender, sexual identity, sexual preference, political affiliation, or social group or status, or imply the intent to do so. Examples include: Usernames that contain discriminatory attacks, racial slurs, or pejorative terms Usernames that praise highly contentious people, groups (also known as "" hate groups ""), or events— future, past, or present —that currently allocate, have allocated, or plan to allocate efforts or resources toward afflicting direct discriminatory, social, physical, or emotional harm toward those who identify as part of any of these groups. Usernames that contain or imply personal attacks , or imply the intent to personally attack, harass , or threaten other Wikipedia editors. Usernames that appear intended to disrupt legitimate Wikipedia discussions and processes by provoking negative emotional reactions from other editors (also known as "" trolling ""). Usernames that show or imply the intent to vandalize , disrupt , or engage in bad-faith edits or behaviors that are clearly not intended to help build, expand, or grow the encyclopedia in a positive or collaborative manner. These accounts, upon their discovery, should be immediately blocked by administrators , and consideration should be given, with appropriate judgment, if the username should be redacted from any logs or edit revisions - especially if they're grossly offensive or destructive in nature, and likely to offend many editors. Note that usernames that are inappropriate in another language, or that represent an inappropriate name with misspellings and substitutions, or do so indirectly or by implication, are still considered inappropriate. Usernames with libelous, contentious, or non-public information See also: Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons § Remove contentious material , and Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons § Usernames Shortcut WP:BLPABUSE The following types of usernames are not permitted, and will be immediately blocked upon discovery , because they violate highly important and serious Wikipedia policies : Usernames that contain contentious or disparaging statements about another person (whether they be another editor, a notable living or recently deceased person , etc). Usernames that are clearly libelous, contain blatantly false or disparaging statements or accusations about another person, or constitute blatant violations of Wikipedia's policy on the biographies of living people . Usernames that contain any non-public, private, or personally identifiable information about another person, [2] or contain any other information that would be deemed appropriate for suppression by an Oversighter ; e.g. usernames that state what the password to the account (apparently) is. These accounts, upon their discovery, should be immediately blocked by administrators . If such usernames are libelous or contain information that is usually suppressed (such as disclosure of non-public personal identifiable information about another editor, or blatantly libelous statements made about a notable living person), the username should be suppressed from all logs by an Oversighter to protect Wikipedia and the subjects involved from any kind of negative fallout or harm as a result of the account or username creation. Requests for removing attack usernames from logs should be reported to the global Stewards team for evaluation and private removal from all WMF projects. This can be done either via IRC in the #wikimedia-stewards connect channel or via email to the stewards VRT queue at stewards wikimedia.org . Misleading usernames Shortcut WP:MISLEADNAME The following types of usernames are not permitted because they may be misleading in a way that disrupts the project: Usernames that impersonate other people (see § Real names and § Similar usernames below). Usernames that give the impression that the account has permissions that it does not have; e.g. by containing the terms "" administrator "", "" bureaucrat "", "" steward "", "" checkuser "", "" oversight "", or similar terms, such as ""admin"", ""sysop"", or ""moderator"". Usernames that imply that the account has explicit ownership of certain articles, content, or topic areas, or that they have any kind of ""power"", ""command"", ""control"", or ""authority"" over other editors, or that a different level of accountability and application of Wikipedia's policies and guidelines should be enforced (such as implying that certain policies do not apply to them). Usernames that could be easily misunderstood to refer to a ""bot"" (which is used to identify bot accounts ) or a ""script"" (which alludes to automated editing processes), unless the account is of that type. Usernames that give the incorrect impression that the account is officially affiliated with the Wikimedia Foundation ; e.g. by containing ""WMF"". Usernames that resemble IP addresses (as these are expected to designate non-logged-in users), timestamps, or other names which would be confusing within the Wikipedia signature format. Usernames that appear similar to naming conventions used by community administrative processes, such as those starting with Vanished user (see Wikipedia:Courtesy vanishing ). For accounts with usernames that are in this category, you should assume good faith in cases where the username could be interpreted ambiguously. For example, a new user whose career is as a sysop might include that in their username, unaware of the policy prohibiting it. An attempt to discuss the username policy and concern with the user, and a request that they change their username should typically be attempted before considering further action. In cases where the violation of policy or the user's intent is clear, or likely created in bad faith, you should exhibit the use of common sense and fair and level-headed judgment when determining the appropriate action to take. These clear violations should be reported by following the instructions on Wikipedia:Usernames for administrator attention . Promotional usernames Shortcuts WP:ORGNAME WP:CORPNAME WP:SPAMNAME WP:PROMONAME ""WP:ORGNAME"" redirects here. For the convention for organization names, see Wikipedia:Naming conventions (companies) . See also: Category:Wikipedians who are indefinitely blocked for promotional user names The following types of usernames are not permitted because they are considered promotional : Usernames that unambiguously represent the name of a company, organization, website, product, musical group or band, team, club, creative group, or organized event (e.g. TownvilleWidgets, MyWidgetsUSA.com, TrammelMuseumofArt, OctoberfestBandConcert2019). However, usernames that contain such names are sometimes permissible; see § Usernames implying shared use below. (Usernames which represent the subject of a biographical article are not considered promotional; see § Stage names ) Email addresses and URLs to domains or websites (especially if they promote a commercial web page) and don't simply identify a person. Although usernames that only contain plain domain names on their own (those that do not include the top-level domain , such as .com , .net , .co.kr , etc. at the end) are sometimes acceptable (such as when the purpose is simply to identify the user as a person), they are inappropriate if their primary purpose is to advertise, promote, sell, gain support, or increase the attention or user-base audience of any person, company, market, product, channel, website, or other good or service. This includes any kind of websites that function in order to generate any kind of income or revenue for the owner. Examples include Patreon links or links to pages asking for donations, or revenue-generating click-thru links to vendors. All pages that are built or designed in one or more of these manners should be considered a commercial web page, and hence considered inappropriate for a username. A user who both adopts a promotional username and who engages in inappropriate advertising or promotional edits or behaviors – especially when made to their own user space or to articles about the company, group, or product – can be blocked from editing Wikipedia, and are often blocked much sooner than users who engage in only one of the two behaviors. In such cases, administrators should examine the user's edits to decide whether or not to allow them to create a new username. If there is evidence that the user would continue to edit inappropriately under a new username, the blocking administrator should enable the "" autoblock "" and ""prevent account creation"" block settings. Otherwise, the user should be offered the opportunity to create a new account or have their current username changed. Before taking action, any disagreements as to whether a particular username is acceptable or not should be discussed at Wikipedia:Requests for comment/User names first . Usernames implying shared use Shortcut WP:ISU See also: Wikipedia:Sockpuppetry § Role accounts Because Wikipedia's policy states that user accounts cannot be shared between more than one individual, the following types of usernames are not permitted because they imply shared use : Usernames that are simply names of companies or groups are not permitted (these also fall under § Promotional usernames above). Personal usernames that imply shared access, such as ""Jack and Jill"", are not permitted. Usernames that are solely the names of posts, positions, roles, or job titles within organizations, such as ""Secretary of the XYZ Foundation"", are not permitted, as such posts or positions may be transferred or held by different persons at different times. However, usernames are acceptable if they contain a company or group name but are clearly intended to denote an individual person, such as ""Mark at WidgetFactory"", ""Jack Smith at the XYZ Foundation"", ""FacebookFanatic87"", etc. Remember that promotional editing is not permitted, regardless of any account's chosen username. The conflict of interest guideline advises all users to exercise caution if editing articles about businesses, organizations, products, or other subjects that they are closely connected to. If you choose to edit articles that are in any way related to your company or group, you will need to carefully follow Wikipedia's advice on editing with a conflict of interest . Non-script usernames Shortcuts WP:NOEMOJI WP:NONSCRIPT The following types of usernames are not permitted due to the difficulty with some web browsers in viewing non-language Unicode characters: [3] Usernames that contain emoji . Usernames that are considered to be emoticons or otherwise ""decorative"". Usernames that use any non-language symbols. This includes: Symbols and characters unrelated to the list of writing systems . Symbols and characters that are on the block lists at Unicode symbols . Note that this restriction does not apply to signatures, which are governed by Wikipedia's policies on the use of signatures . Confusing usernames Shortcut WP:UNCONF Some usernames appear problematic without fitting clearly into any of the above categories. This is often the case with confusing or extremely lengthy usernames, which are highly discouraged but which are not so inappropriate on their own as to require action. Confusing usernames can often be a red flag for other problems. An editor with a confusing username or signature may be blocked sooner than usual for other inappropriate behavior, such as disruption or vandalism, if their confusing username contributes to the disruption. Exceptions Some usernames that appear to be in breach of this policy have been allowed to stand by consensus because they were created before a change in the policy that would now prohibit such names (see grandfather clause ) . If you find an apparently problematic username being used by a long-standing editor, it is likely that the matter has been discussed before. Please search that user's talk page (and archives if applicable), and the archives of the administrators' noticeboards and requests for comment on usernames , before deciding to take action as described below . Dealing with inappropriate usernames Shortcut WP:BADNAME If you encounter an inappropriate username as described above , there are various actions you might take. Use common sense in making your choice, and avoid ""biting"" newcomers . No action necessary If the name is not unambiguously problematic, it may be sensible to ignore it. Assume good faith , and also note the exceptions in the section on inappropriate usernames. Also, except in extreme cases, it is probably not worth taking action unless the user has made at least one recent edit. Talk to the user If you see a username that is problematic but was not obviously created in bad faith, politely draw the user's attention to this policy, and try to encourage them to create a new account with a different username. If you want, you can use the {{ subst:uw-username }}, {{ subst:uw-uall }} or {{ subst:uw-coi-username }} template for this. Request for comment If, following an attempt to discuss a problematic username with the user, there is still doubt or disagreement as to whether the name is appropriate, you may open a Request for comment on the username , inviting other users to discuss the issue. Report blatant violations If you believe that a username needs to be immediately blocked and is an obvious violation of policy, you can report it to Usernames for administrator attention . This page should only be used for clear and egregious username violations that merit an immediate block and without any discussion or warning beforehand. Do not both warn a user account or discuss the username and your concerns with a user account, and file a report against the user account at Usernames for administrator attention at the same time. A warning or discussion by another editor should be perceived as an invitation or an encouragement for the user to change their username or otherwise resolve the matter at-hand, while filing a report against the account invites a block to be immediately placed and without warning or discussion beforehand. These two actions directly counteract with one another; performing both actions can cause confusion, frustration, and the biting of newcomers where the assumption of good faith likely should have been the preferred initial response. Report other problems If the user with a bad username is breaching other policies, such as those against spam or vandalism , follow up using those policies rather than reporting the username. If the user is editing in a biased or promotional way on a subject they appear to have a connection with, report them at the Conflict of Interest noticeboard . Usernames for administrator attention guidelines Usernames for administrator attention (UAA) is a noticeboard for drawing attention to abusive usernames quickly. See Wikipedia:Usernames for administrator attention/Instructions for information on how to place or resolve UAA reports, including the options that are available to administrators. Remember that blocking a new user is not actually something we want to do, it is something we do when it is needed to protect Wikipedia from harm. Generally, editors whose usernames are a technical or borderline violation of the Username policy should be given an opportunity to discuss the username and how they may register a new username. However, users who are reluctant to register a new username and are otherwise showing a positive history of contributions to Wikipedia should be allowed to continue editing in a positive fashion and the matter should be dropped. But this exemption does not apply to editors who have a clearly offensive username, disruptive or vandalizing edits, or edits that show a history of problematic bias or conflict of interest. Other particular types of username Real names ""WP:IMPERSONATE"" redirects here. For impersonation regarding signatures, see WP:Signature forgery . Shortcuts WP:REALNAME WP:IMPERSONATE Minors and children are strongly discouraged from creating accounts with usernames that are their real names, or any nicknames which might be traced to them , and all editors should carefully consider the consequences before doing so . Usernames with this information significantly increase the potential for harassment , especially if these accounts edit in controversial subject areas. In some countries, editing Wikipedia can be illegal, and using your real name can put you at risk of legal consequences. While it is possible to rename your account later (see Changing your username below), a record of your previous username remains permanently. Do not edit under a name that is likely to imply that you are (or are related to) a specific, identifiable person, unless it is your real name. If you have the same name as a well-known person to whom you are unrelated, and are using your real name, you should state clearly on your userpage that you are unrelated to the well-known person. If a username implies that the user is, or is related to, a notable , identifiable or well-known person, the account may be blocked as a precaution against impersonation until the user's proof of identity is provided. If you have been blocked for using your real name, please do not take offense; we are trying to prevent somebody from impersonating or harassing you, or someone you may share the same real name with. You are welcome to use your real name, but in some cases, you will need to prove that you are who you say you are. You can do this by sending an email to info-en wikimedia.org . Be aware that emails are handled by a volunteer response team ; it can take some time before you'll receive a reply. Do not send unsolicited scans of your passport or driver's license to the volunteer response team. Instead, you should contact them to find out the best way to prove your identity. The best way will vary, but could be by using a mail address on a domain name that belongs to you. Stage names Shortcut WP:USERSTAGENAME Users may use their stage name , pen name , or other nickname as their username, provided that it uniquely identifies a single person. This is not considered promotional, even if commercial performances or publications are made under such a name, unless the user makes promotional edits within Wikipedia about themselves, their projects, etc. However, a user may not use someone else's stage name as a username, as per the § Real names section of this page. Usernames with non-Latin characters Shortcuts WP:NONLATIN WP:LATINPLEASE See also: Wikipedia:Unified login and Wikipedia:Signatures § Non-Latin Users with usernames in non- Latin script writing systems are welcome to edit Wikipedia. There is no requirement that usernames must be in English or that Latin script characters must be used. However, such usernames may appear illegible to other contributors to the English Wikipedia, and not every user's keyboard or input device may have immediate access to non-Latin characters. In addition, sometimes certain characters may not display correctly. As a courtesy to other contributors, and to avoid possible confusion or mis-identification, users with such usernames are encouraged to consider providing a Latin-character transliteration of their username on their userpage , and/or as their signature . For technical reasons, usernames containing the forbidden characters # < > [ ] | { } , as well as / @ : = , are not possible. [4] Similar usernames Shortcuts WP:IMPERSONATOR WP:SIMILARNAME Usernames that are very similar to existing ones cannot be registered normally – but if you do want to use one, you may request its creation at Wikipedia:Request an account . Usernames that are similar only to unused or inactive accounts should not be a problem. Special:CentralAuth can be used to check for such usernames. The program that checks for similarity is a bit over-sensitive—if the username is different enough as to prevent other people from confusing the two users, the request should be approved. One should not choose a username that implies a relationship with an existing editor (unless the account is actually owned or the relationship is acknowledged by the editor themselves). If your username is similar to that of another contributor or an article, you may wish to provide some form of disambiguation , such as by adding {{ distinguish }} to the top of your user page . Commonly misspelled usernames If your username is commonly misspelled, consider helping people by adding redirects to your actual user page and talk page from the misspelled titles. You may wish to consider registering the misspelled username as a doppelgänger account to prevent it from being registered by someone else. The software prevents registration of certain names that are found to be too similar to existing ones; if you cannot register your doppelgänger username for this reason, you should visit Wikipedia:Request an account . UseModWiki-era anonymous users Shortcut WP:USEMODDOMAIN UseModWiki , the software used on Wikipedia throughout 2001 and in early 2002, treated users who edited without logging in or providing a screen name differently from modern-day MediaWiki. Anonymous users in that time were treated in one of two ways: Domain names: Up until about March 2001, an editor with an IP address ""192.0.2.34"" that was associated with domain name ""host.2.34.example.net"" would have their edit logged as being by ""host.2.34.example.net"". Examples of this are office.bomis.com , dhcp-22-128.lclark.edu , and cnts2p46.uwaterloo.ca . Contributions by users with these usernames are affected by T2323 . These usernames are usually indefinitely blocked on sight, as a) they don't make good usernames in light of the above criteria, b) they were never true usernames in the first place and would thus have been abandoned with changing software, and c) modern software is such that an innocent contributor editing from the ""host.2.34.example.net"" server would not be affected by a block of ""User:host.2.34.example.net"". Redacted IP addresses: An editor with that same IP address that was not associated with any domain name (or all UseModWiki edits after about March 2001) would have their edit logged as being by ""192.0.2.xxx"". The Phase II software also exhibited this trait. Examples of this are 209.69.30.xxx and 62.110.183.xxx . Shared accounts See also: Wikipedia:Sockpuppetry § Role accounts Shortcuts WP:NOSHARING WP:SHAREDACCOUNT Any user account should represent an individual and not a group (and an individual should normally only have one user account; see next section). Sharing an account – or the password to an account – with others is not permitted, and evidence of doing so will result in the user being required to stop the practice and change their password, or in sanctions (up to and including the account being blocked), depending on circumstances. For accounts being used to represent a group or organization, see § Promotional usernames and § Usernames implying shared use above. Exceptions to this rule can be made for non-editing accounts approved to provide email access, accounts approved by the Wikimedia Foundation (see list ), and bot accounts that are maintained by more than one contributor, provided the existence of such an arrangement is made clear and has consensus. Using multiple accounts Shortcuts WP:MULTIPLE WP:MULTIACCOUNT Main page: Wikipedia:Sockpuppetry § Legitimate uses It is recommended that contributors not use multiple accounts without good reason. For example, a user may wish to create an alternate account for use on public computers as a precaution to keep their primary account more secure. Contributors operating any sort of automated editing process should do so under an alternative bot account . It is recommended that multiple accounts be identified as such on their user pages ; templates such as {{ User alternative account }} or one of a selection of user boxes may be used for this purpose. The use of multiple accounts outside of established policy for doing so is known as sockpuppetry , and is not permitted. For example, multiple accounts may not be used to comment on proposals or requests, cast votes, or engage in edit warring . Because policies apply to individuals, not accounts, blocked or banned users must not use sock puppets to circumvent a block; doing so will result in an extension of the block or ban. Changing your username Shortcut WP:UNC Usernames can be changed by global renamers ; requests should be made at Wikipedia:Changing username . User accounts with few or no edits might not be renamed, as it is quicker and easier to simply create a new account . Once a username has been changed, existing contributions will be listed under the new name in page histories , diffs , logs , and user contributions . Signatures on discussion pages will continue to use the old name; while these can be changed manually, it is not recommended unless a contributor wishes to remove as much information as possible about their former name for privacy reasons. In such situations the old name will still be available in old versions of discussion pages, unless revision deletion is used and log entries are hidden from public view. Username changes are listed in the user rename log and the global rename log . Deleting and merging accounts It is not possible to delete user accounts, as all contributions must be assigned to some identifier, either a username or an IP address . [5] Editors seeking privacy per courtesy vanishing / right to vanish can usually have their accounts renamed and their user pages (and, in exceptional cases, user talk pages) deleted . It is not currently possible to merge more than one user account together and combine them into one user account on the English Wikipedia.

When addressing these potential Scunthorpe problems , administrators should use common sense and assume good faith . User:AmandaNP/UAA/Blacklist notes some common sources of false positives; looking up a username or its components in a search engine may also be helpful. ^ The username is considered a violation of this policy, and the creation of the account considered an attempt to disclose non-public or personally identifiable information about another person, regardless of the legitimacy of the information shared and whether or not the information was correct. ^ Decided after an 2017 RfC ^ The ""/"" character is used for subpages of userpages.

For the Wikipedia essay about redirects, see Wikipedia:Redirects are cheap . For the related essay, see Wikipedia:Redirects are costly . For requesting article creation, see WP:RA . Welcome to the request an account page Shortcut WP:ACC This page is for requesting a Wikipedia account be created for you in the event that you are unable to create one yourself using the account creation page . Being unable to create an account for yourself is typically due to: Having trouble or being unable to see or complete the required CAPTCHA image verification step. Choosing a username that is too similar to an existing username (in these cases, an account creator can approve the creation of similar usernames if certain criteria are met). Using a shared IP address or network connection (such as a public, school, or enterprise network) that has been blocked from editing Wikipedia, restricting you from creating an account yourself. Matching certain blacklisted criteria. Are you in the right place? This page is only for requesting the creation of a new Wikipedia account. This page is not for requesting assistance with an existing account, or the recovery of a lost account. If you are having issues accessing your existing Wikipedia account, you can reset your password . If you wish to change the username on your existing Wikipedia account, you can create a username change request . If you are currently blocked from editing Wikipedia, you can resolve this matter by appealing your block . If you need help with creating an article or editing Wikipedia, you can visit the Help Desk to ask for editing assistance . To prevent the automated creation of Wikipedia accounts using bots or scripts , Wikipedia uses an image verification method (called a CAPTCHA ) to assure that new accounts are being created by a real person. To further combat account creation abuse, Wikipedia also prevents the creation of new accounts with usernames that are too similar to other existing Wikipedia accounts. If you have attempted to create an account but are having trouble with the CAPTCHA image verification step (perhaps because you are using a screen reader or a browser that does not support images), or if you have chosen a username that is too similar to an existing username, you can request an account be created for you. English Wikipedia username policy summary Your username must represent you as an individual person Usernames are not allowed on Wikipedia if they: only contain the names of companies, organizations, websites, musical groups or bands, teams, clubs, creative groups, or organized events only describe a particular role, title, position, department, or a group or team of people within a parent organization or group that can be represented or held by multiple people or by different people are promotional in nature, or appear intended to advertise, promote, sell, gain support, or increase the attention or user-base audience of any person, company, market, product, channel, website, or other good or service imply that your user account will be shared between more than one person Your username must be truthful, appropriate, and not foster a negative editing environment Usernames are not allowed on Wikipedia and will be immediately blocked upon discovery if they: are offensive, profane, violent, threatening, sexually explicit, or disruptive, or that advocate or encourage any such behavior (including criminal or illegal acts) contain statements that are libelous, contentious, or disparaging, or that disclose any private or non-public information about somebody else (either another editor, or a notable living person) are deliberately deceptive, confusing, misleading, unnecessarily long, similar to the username of other accounts, or attempt to impersonate or falsely represent somebody else (another editor, a notable living person, an ""official"" Wikimedia Foundation account, etc.) in bad faith imply that the account has explicit ownership of any articles, content, or topic areas, or any kind of ""power"" or ""authority"" over other editors, a different application of Wikipedia's policies and guidelines (such as implying that certain policies do not apply to them), or that the account has any administrative or ""moderator"" access levels or user rights imply the intent to troll, vandalize , disrupt , advertise , or spam Wikipedia imply the intent to personally attack , harass , or threaten other Wikipedia users imply that you are not here to build an encyclopedia or will use Wikipedia for purposes that it was not created for Instructions To request an account using the 'Request an Account' process, please read and follow all of the instructions below: Before you begin Review and understand Wikipedia's Username Policy , as any account request for a username that is in violation of this policy will not be approved. Remember that you should generally only use one Wikipedia account . [1] You are required to disclose all of your alternative and previously used accounts in your request using the 'Comments' field. Any account requests that show evidence or the indication that you have ownership of an undisclosed account will not be approved. Any requests made with the intention of using the account as an illegitimate alternative (such as to hide edits or conduct, evade or circumvent blocks or sanctions , or cause disruption ) will not be approved. Additionally, your attempt(s) may be reported, and may result in additional sanctions. Understand that this is not the place to request assistance with the deletion or recovery of any existing accounts . If you have forgotten your password, and you did not register your account with an e-mail address, then it cannot be recovered. Your only option is to create a new account and request a usurpation of your old username. Register an email address if you do not have one. You must verify your email address in order to complete your account creation request and submit it for review. Your account must also have your email address in order for it to be recovered in the event that you lose the ability to access it. When you are ready to begin Click the "" Request an account "" link below, and a wizard will assist you. If you're directed to complete a form in order to request an account, fill out all fields . Check your e-mail inbox for updates and further instructions regarding your account request. If your request is approved and your account has been created successfully, you will receive an automated e-mail from wiki wikimedia.org with your username and a randomly generated password to your new account. You can use these credentials to log in , where you will then be prompted to create a new password. If there are problems with your request, you will receive an email with an explanation and the reason your account request could not be approved. You are welcome to submit a new account request using a different username. Didn't receive your account update email? We hope to process an account request the same day of its submission. However, it is not uncommon for requests to take 2-3 days depending on the work load and volume of requests currently pending review. In rare cases (such as server downtime or the sudden submission of an extremely high amount of legitimate account requests), requests may take longer. Please be patient; your request will be processed as soon as possible. Before submitting a new request or inquiring about the progress of your current request: Check your email's ""spam"" folder. Most often, the email was mistakenly flagged as spam. Verify that the account update email wasn't accidentally moved or otherwise triggered by any email filters or rules that you have set up for your inbox. Check all of your directories and sub-directories, and search for wiki wikimedia.org to see if it arrived. Did you request an account using an email address from Gmail ? Your ACC request update may have been automatically filtered into one of the five default Category tabs that are enabled by default (usually the ""Social"" or ""Promotions"" category). Check each category and verify that the email wasn't automatically routed from your inbox and into one of them. Try recovering the account that you requested. If your request was approved and you just didn't receive the email containing your temporary password, you can have a new password generated and emailed to you by filling out Wikipedia's password reset form.
