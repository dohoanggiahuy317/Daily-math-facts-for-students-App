} In calculus , a one-sided limit refers to either one of the two limits of a function f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(x)} of a real variable x {\displaystyle x} as x {\displaystyle x} approaches a specified point either from the left or from the right.

[1] [2] The limit as x {\displaystyle x} decreases in value approaching a {\displaystyle a} ( x {\displaystyle x} approaches a {\displaystyle a} "from the right" [3] or "from above") can be denoted: [1] [2] lim x → a + f ( x ) or lim x ↓ a f ( x ) or lim x ↘ a f ( x ) or f ( x + ) {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to a^{+}}f(x)\quad {\text{ or }}\quad \lim _{x\,\downarrow \,a}\,f(x)\quad {\text{ or }}\quad \lim _{x\searrow a}\,f(x)\quad {\text{ or }}\quad f(x+)} The limit as x {\displaystyle x} increases in value approaching a {\displaystyle a} ( x {\displaystyle x} approaches a {\displaystyle a} "from the left" [4] [5] or "from below") can be denoted: [1] [2] lim x → a − f ( x ) or lim x ↑ a f ( x ) or lim x ↗ a f ( x ) or f ( x − ) {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to a^{-}}f(x)\quad {\text{ or }}\quad \lim _{x\,\uparrow \,a}\,f(x)\quad {\text{ or }}\quad \lim _{x\nearrow a}\,f(x)\quad {\text{ or }}\quad f(x-)} If the limit of f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(x)} as x {\displaystyle x} approaches a {\displaystyle a} exists then the limits from the left and from the right both exist and are equal.

In some cases in which the limit lim x → a f ( x ) {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to a}f(x)} does not exist, the two one-sided limits nonetheless exist.

Consequently, the limit as x {\displaystyle x} approaches a {\displaystyle a} is sometimes called a "two-sided limit".

[ citation needed ] It is possible for exactly one of the two one-sided limits to exist (while the other does not exist).

It is also possible for neither of the two one-sided limits to exist.

Formal definition [ edit ] Definition [ edit ] If I {\displaystyle I} represents some interval that is contained in the domain of f {\displaystyle f} and if a {\displaystyle a} is a point in I {\displaystyle I} then the right-sided limit as x {\displaystyle x} approaches a {\displaystyle a} can be rigorously defined as the value R {\displaystyle R} that satisfies: [6] [ verification needed ] for all ε > 0 there exists some δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ I , if 0 < x − a < δ then | f ( x ) − R | < ε , {\displaystyle {\text{for all }}\varepsilon >0\;{\text{ there exists some }}\delta >0\;{\text{ such that for all }}x\in I,{\text{ if }}\;0<x-a<\delta {\text{ then }}|f(x)-R|<\varepsilon ,} and the left-sided limit as x {\displaystyle x} approaches a {\displaystyle a} can be rigorously defined as the value L {\displaystyle L} that satisfies: for all ε > 0 there exists some δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ I , if 0 < a − x < δ then | f ( x ) − L | < ε.

{\displaystyle {\text{for all }}\varepsilon >0\;{\text{ there exists some }}\delta >0\;{\text{ such that for all }}x\in I,{\text{ if }}\;0<a-x<\delta {\text{ then }}|f(x)-L|<\varepsilon.

} We can represent the same thing more symbolically, as follows.

Let I {\displaystyle I} represent an interval, where I ⊆ d o m a i n ( f ) {\displaystyle I\subseteq \mathrm {domain} (f)} , and a ∈ I {\displaystyle a\in I}.

lim x → a + f ( x ) = R ⟺ ( ∀ ε ∈ R + , ∃ δ ∈ R + , ∀ x ∈ I , ( 0 < x − a < δ ⟶ | f ( x ) − R | < ε ) ) {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to a^{+}}f(x)=R~~~\iff ~~~(\forall \varepsilon \in \mathbb {R} _{+},\exists \delta \in \mathbb {R} _{+},\forall x\in I,(0<x-a<\delta \longrightarrow |f(x)-R|<\varepsilon ))} lim x → a − f ( x ) = L ⟺ ( ∀ ε ∈ R + , ∃ δ ∈ R + , ∀ x ∈ I , ( 0 < a − x < δ ⟶ | f ( x ) − L | < ε ) ) {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to a^{-}}f(x)=L~~~\iff ~~~(\forall \varepsilon \in \mathbb {R} _{+},\exists \delta \in \mathbb {R} _{+},\forall x\in I,(0<a-x<\delta \longrightarrow |f(x)-L|<\varepsilon ))} Intuition [ edit ] In comparison to the formal definition for the limit of a function at a point, the one-sided limit (as the name would suggest) only deals with input values to one side of the approached input value.

For reference, the formal definition for the limit of a function at a point is as follows: lim x → a f ( x ) = L ⟺ ∀ ε ∈ R + , ∃ δ ∈ R + , ∀ x ∈ I , 0 < | x − a | < δ ⟹ | f ( x ) − L | < ε.

{\displaystyle \lim _{x\to a}f(x)=L~~~\iff ~~~\forall \varepsilon \in \mathbb {R} _{+},\exists \delta \in \mathbb {R} _{+},\forall x\in I,0<|x-a|<\delta \implies |f(x)-L|<\varepsilon.

} To define a one-sided limit, we must modify this inequality.

Note that the absolute distance between x {\displaystyle x} and a {\displaystyle a} is | x − a | = | ( − 1 ) ( − x + a ) | = | ( − 1 ) ( a − x ) | = | ( − 1 ) | | a − x | = | a − x |.

{\displaystyle |x-a|=|(-1)(-x+a)|=|(-1)(a-x)|=|(-1)||a-x|=|a-x|.

} For the limit from the right, we want x {\displaystyle x} to be to the right of a {\displaystyle a} , which means that a < x {\displaystyle a<x} , so x − a {\displaystyle x-a} is positive.

From above, x − a {\displaystyle x-a} is the distance between x {\displaystyle x} and a {\displaystyle a}.

We want to bound this distance by our value of δ {\displaystyle \delta } , giving the inequality x − a < δ {\displaystyle x-a<\delta }.

Putting together the inequalities 0 < x − a {\displaystyle 0<x-a} and x − a < δ {\displaystyle x-a<\delta } and using the transitivity property of inequalities, we have the compound inequality 0 < x − a < δ {\displaystyle 0<x-a<\delta }.

Similarly, for the limit from the left, we want x {\displaystyle x} to be to the left of a {\displaystyle a} , which means that x < a {\displaystyle x<a}.

In this case, it is a − x {\displaystyle a-x} that is positive and represents the distance between x {\displaystyle x} and a {\displaystyle a}.

Again, we want to bound this distance by our value of δ {\displaystyle \delta } , leading to the compound inequality 0 < a − x < δ {\displaystyle 0<a-x<\delta }.

Now, when our value of x {\displaystyle x} is in its desired interval, we expect that the value of f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(x)} is also within its desired interval.

The distance between f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(x)} and L {\displaystyle L} , the limiting value of the left sided limit, is | f ( x ) − L | {\displaystyle |f(x)-L|}.

Similarly, the distance between f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(x)} and R {\displaystyle R} , the limiting value of the right sided limit, is | f ( x ) − R | {\displaystyle |f(x)-R|}.

In both cases, we want to bound this distance by ε {\displaystyle \varepsilon } , so we get the following: | f ( x ) − L | < ε {\displaystyle |f(x)-L|<\varepsilon } for the left sided limit, and | f ( x ) − R | < ε {\displaystyle |f(x)-R|<\varepsilon } for the right sided limit.

Examples [ edit ] Example 1 : The limits from the left and from the right of g ( x ) := − 1 x {\displaystyle g(x):=-{\frac {1}{x}}} as x {\displaystyle x} approaches a := 0 {\displaystyle a:=0} are lim x → 0 − − 1 / x = + ∞ and lim x → 0 + − 1 / x = − ∞ {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0^{-}}{-1/x}=+\infty \qquad {\text{ and }}\qquad \lim _{x\to 0^{+}}{-1/x}=-\infty } The reason why lim x → 0 − − 1 / x = + ∞ {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0^{-}}{-1/x}=+\infty } is because x {\displaystyle x} is always negative (since x → 0 − {\displaystyle x\to 0^{-}} means that x → 0 {\displaystyle x\to 0} with all values of x {\displaystyle x} satisfying x < 0 {\displaystyle x<0} ), which implies that − 1 / x {\displaystyle -1/x} is always positive so that lim x → 0 − − 1 / x {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0^{-}}{-1/x}} diverges [note 1] to + ∞ {\displaystyle +\infty } (and not to − ∞ {\displaystyle -\infty } ) as x {\displaystyle x} approaches 0 {\displaystyle 0} from the left.

Similarly, lim x → 0 + − 1 / x = − ∞ {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0^{+}}{-1/x}=-\infty } since all values of x {\displaystyle x} satisfy x > 0 {\displaystyle x>0} (said differently, x {\displaystyle x} is always positive) as x {\displaystyle x} approaches 0 {\displaystyle 0} from the right, which implies that − 1 / x {\displaystyle -1/x} is always negative so that lim x → 0 + − 1 / x {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0^{+}}{-1/x}} diverges to − ∞.

{\displaystyle -\infty.

} Plot of the function 1 / ( 1 + 2 − 1 / x ).

{\displaystyle 1/(1+2^{-1/x}).

} Example 2 : One example of a function with different one-sided limits is f ( x ) = 1 1 + 2 − 1 / x , {\displaystyle f(x)={\frac {1}{1+2^{-1/x}}},} (cf.

picture) where the limit from the left is lim x → 0 − f ( x ) = 0 {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0^{-}}f(x)=0} and the limit from the right is lim x → 0 + f ( x ) = 1.

{\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0^{+}}f(x)=1.

} To calculate these limits, first show that lim x → 0 − 2 − 1 / x = ∞ and lim x → 0 + 2 − 1 / x = 0 {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0^{-}}2^{-1/x}=\infty \qquad {\text{ and }}\qquad \lim _{x\to 0^{+}}2^{-1/x}=0} (which is true because lim x → 0 − − 1 / x = + ∞ and lim x → 0 + − 1 / x = − ∞ {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0^{-}}{-1/x}=+\infty {\text{ and }}\lim _{x\to 0^{+}}{-1/x}=-\infty } ) so that consequently, lim x → 0 + 1 1 + 2 − 1 / x = 1 1 + lim x → 0 + 2 − 1 / x = 1 1 + 0 = 1 {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0^{+}}{\frac {1}{1+2^{-1/x}}}={\frac {1}{1+\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0^{+}}2^{-1/x}}}={\frac {1}{1+0}}=1} whereas lim x → 0 − 1 1 + 2 − 1 / x = 0 {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0^{-}}{\frac {1}{1+2^{-1/x}}}=0} because the denominator diverges to infinity; that is, because lim x → 0 − 1 + 2 − 1 / x = ∞.

{\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0^{-}}1+2^{-1/x}=\infty.

} Since lim x → 0 − f ( x ) ≠ lim x → 0 + f ( x ) , {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0^{-}}f(x)\neq \lim _{x\to 0^{+}}f(x),} the limit lim x → 0 f ( x ) {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0}f(x)} does not exist.

Relation to topological definition of limit [ edit ] See also: Filters in topology The one-sided limit to a point p {\displaystyle p} corresponds to the general definition of limit , with the domain of the function restricted to one side, by either allowing that the function domain is a subset of the topological space, or by considering a one-sided subspace, including p.

{\displaystyle p.

} [1] [ verification needed ] Alternatively, one may consider the domain with a half-open interval topology.
