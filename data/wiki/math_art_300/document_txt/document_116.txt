June Barrow-Green (born 1953) [1] is a professor of History of Mathematics at the Open University [2] and a visiting professor at the London School of Economics.

[3] Education [ edit ] Barrow-Green obtained a BSc Hons in Mathematics in 1986 and an MSc in Mathematical Physics in 1989, both from King's College London.

In 1993 she gained a PhD in mathematics from the Open University , under supervision of Jeremy Gray , on Poincaré and the Three Body Problem.

[4] Career [ edit ] From 1993 to the present Barrow-Green has worked at the Open University, receiving a professorship in 2015.

From 2003 to 2005 she was president of the British Society for the History of Mathematics.

[5] From 2007 to 2018 she was an elected member of the Council of the London Mathematical Society and during that period she served as the Librarian for the society.

[6] In 2014 Barrow-Green was awarded the first Chandler Davis Prize for Expository Excellence for her article An American Goes to Europe: Three Letters from Oswald Veblen to George Birkhoff in 1913/1914 in The Mathematical Intelligencer.

[7] In 2018 she took part in a discussion panel on The Gender Gap in Mathematical and Natural Sciences from a Historical Perspective at the International Congress of Mathematicians 2018, Rio de Janeiro, which was chaired by the English mathematician Caroline Series and also featured the French mathematician Marie-Françoise Roy and the Argentine physicist Silvina Ponce Dawson [ fr ].

[8] She chairs the executive committee of the International Commission on the History of Mathematics.

[9] In August 2021 The Royal Society awarded her its Wilkins-Bernal-Medawar medal "for her research in 19th & 20th century mathematics, with emphasis on the underrepresentation of women in historical narratives & contemporary mathematics".
