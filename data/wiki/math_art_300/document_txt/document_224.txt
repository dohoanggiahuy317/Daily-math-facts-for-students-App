[1] [2] [3] Let h ( x ) = f ( x ) g ( x ) {\displaystyle h(x)={\frac {f(x)}{g(x)}}} , where both f and g are differentiable and g ( x ) ≠ 0.

{\displaystyle g(x)\neq 0.

} The quotient rule states that the derivative of h ( x ) is h ′ ( x ) = f ′ ( x ) g ( x ) − f ( x ) g ′ ( x ) ( g ( x ) ) 2.

{\displaystyle h'(x)={\frac {f'(x)g(x)-f(x)g'(x)}{(g(x))^{2}}}.

} It is provable in many ways by using other derivative rules.

Examples [ edit ] Example 1: Basic example [ edit ] Given h ( x ) = e x x 2 {\displaystyle h(x)={\frac {e^{x}}{x^{2}}}} , let f ( x ) = e x , g ( x ) = x 2 {\displaystyle f(x)=e^{x},g(x)=x^{2}} , then using the quotient rule: d d x ( e x x 2 ) = ( d d x e x ) ( x 2 ) − ( e x ) ( d d x x 2 ) ( x 2 ) 2 = ( e x ) ( x 2 ) − ( e x ) ( 2 x ) x 4 = x 2 e x − 2 x e x x 4 = x e x − 2 e x x 3 = e x ( x − 2 ) x 3.

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {d}{dx}}\left({\frac {e^{x}}{x^{2}}}\right)&={\frac {\left({\frac {d}{dx}}e^{x}\right)(x^{2})-(e^{x})\left({\frac {d}{dx}}x^{2}\right)}{(x^{2})^{2}}}\\&={\frac {(e^{x})(x^{2})-(e^{x})(2x)}{x^{4}}}\\&={\frac {x^{2}e^{x}-2xe^{x}}{x^{4}}}\\&={\frac {xe^{x}-2e^{x}}{x^{3}}}\\&={\frac {e^{x}(x-2)}{x^{3}}}.

\end{aligned}}} Example 2: Derivative of tangent function [ edit ] The quotient rule can be used to find the derivative of tan ⁡ x = sin ⁡ x cos ⁡ x {\displaystyle \tan x={\frac {\sin x}{\cos x}}} as follows: d d x tan ⁡ x = d d x ( sin ⁡ x cos ⁡ x ) = ( d d x sin ⁡ x ) ( cos ⁡ x ) − ( sin ⁡ x ) ( d d x cos ⁡ x ) cos 2 ⁡ x = ( cos ⁡ x ) ( cos ⁡ x ) − ( sin ⁡ x ) ( − sin ⁡ x ) cos 2 ⁡ x = cos 2 ⁡ x + sin 2 ⁡ x cos 2 ⁡ x = 1 cos 2 ⁡ x = sec 2 ⁡ x.

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {d}{dx}}\tan x&={\frac {d}{dx}}\left({\frac {\sin x}{\cos x}}\right)\\&={\frac {\left({\frac {d}{dx}}\sin x\right)(\cos x)-(\sin x)\left({\frac {d}{dx}}\cos x\right)}{\cos ^{2}x}}\\&={\frac {(\cos x)(\cos x)-(\sin x)(-\sin x)}{\cos ^{2}x}}\\&={\frac {\cos ^{2}x+\sin ^{2}x}{\cos ^{2}x}}\\&={\frac {1}{\cos ^{2}x}}=\sec ^{2}x.

\end{aligned}}} Reciprocal rule [ edit ] Main article: Reciprocal rule The reciprocal rule is a special case of the quotient rule in which the numerator f ( x ) = 1 {\displaystyle f(x)=1}.

Applying the quotient rule gives h ′ ( x ) = d d x [ 1 g ( x ) ] = 0 ⋅ g ( x ) − 1 ⋅ g ′ ( x ) g ( x ) 2 = − g ′ ( x ) g ( x ) 2.

{\displaystyle h'(x)={\frac {d}{dx}}\left[{\frac {1}{g(x)}}\right]={\frac {0\cdot g(x)-1\cdot g'(x)}{g(x)^{2}}}={\frac {-g'(x)}{g(x)^{2}}}.

} Utilizing the chain rule yields the same result.

Proofs [ edit ] Proof from derivative definition and limit properties [ edit ] Let h ( x ) = f ( x ) g ( x ).

{\displaystyle h(x)={\frac {f(x)}{g(x)}}.

} Applying the definition of the derivative and properties of limits gives the following proof, with the term f ( x ) g ( x ) {\displaystyle f(x)g(x)} added and subtracted to allow splitting and factoring in subsequent steps without affecting the value: h ′ ( x ) = lim k → 0 h ( x + k ) − h ( x ) k = lim k → 0 f ( x + k ) g ( x + k ) − f ( x ) g ( x ) k = lim k → 0 f ( x + k ) g ( x ) − f ( x ) g ( x + k ) k ⋅ g ( x ) g ( x + k ) = lim k → 0 f ( x + k ) g ( x ) − f ( x ) g ( x + k ) k ⋅ lim k → 0 1 g ( x ) g ( x + k ) = lim k → 0 [ f ( x + k ) g ( x ) − f ( x ) g ( x ) + f ( x ) g ( x ) − f ( x ) g ( x + k ) k ] ⋅ 1 g ( x ) 2 = [ lim k → 0 f ( x + k ) g ( x ) − f ( x ) g ( x ) k − lim k → 0 f ( x ) g ( x + k ) − f ( x ) g ( x ) k ] ⋅ 1 g ( x ) 2 = [ lim k → 0 f ( x + k ) − f ( x ) k ⋅ g ( x ) − f ( x ) ⋅ lim k → 0 g ( x + k ) − g ( x ) k ] ⋅ 1 g ( x ) 2 = f ′ ( x ) g ( x ) − f ( x ) g ′ ( x ) g ( x ) 2.

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}h'(x)&=\lim _{k\to 0}{\frac {h(x+k)-h(x)}{k}}\\&=\lim _{k\to 0}{\frac {{\frac {f(x+k)}{g(x+k)}}-{\frac {f(x)}{g(x)}}}{k}}\\&=\lim _{k\to 0}{\frac {f(x+k)g(x)-f(x)g(x+k)}{k\cdot g(x)g(x+k)}}\\&=\lim _{k\to 0}{\frac {f(x+k)g(x)-f(x)g(x+k)}{k}}\cdot \lim _{k\to 0}{\frac {1}{g(x)g(x+k)}}\\&=\lim _{k\to 0}\left[{\frac {f(x+k)g(x)-f(x)g(x)+f(x)g(x)-f(x)g(x+k)}{k}}\right]\cdot {\frac {1}{g(x)^{2}}}\\&=\left[\lim _{k\to 0}{\frac {f(x+k)g(x)-f(x)g(x)}{k}}-\lim _{k\to 0}{\frac {f(x)g(x+k)-f(x)g(x)}{k}}\right]\cdot {\frac {1}{g(x)^{2}}}\\&=\left[\lim _{k\to 0}{\frac {f(x+k)-f(x)}{k}}\cdot g(x)-f(x)\cdot \lim _{k\to 0}{\frac {g(x+k)-g(x)}{k}}\right]\cdot {\frac {1}{g(x)^{2}}}\\&={\frac {f'(x)g(x)-f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^{2}}}.

\end{aligned}}} The limit evaluation lim k → 0 1 g ( x + k ) g ( x ) = 1 g ( x ) 2 {\displaystyle \lim _{k\to 0}{\frac {1}{g(x+k)g(x)}}={\frac {1}{g(x)^{2}}}} is justified by the differentiability of g ( x ) {\displaystyle g(x)} , implying continuity, which can be expressed as lim k → 0 g ( x + k ) = g ( x ) {\displaystyle \lim _{k\to 0}g(x+k)=g(x)}.

Proof using implicit differentiation [ edit ] Let h ( x ) = f ( x ) g ( x ) , {\displaystyle h(x)={\frac {f(x)}{g(x)}},} so that f ( x ) = g ( x ) h ( x ).

{\displaystyle f(x)=g(x)h(x).

} The product rule then gives f ′ ( x ) = g ′ ( x ) h ( x ) + g ( x ) h ′ ( x ).

{\displaystyle f'(x)=g'(x)h(x)+g(x)h'(x).

} Solving for h ′ ( x ) {\displaystyle h'(x)} and substituting back for h ( x ) {\displaystyle h(x)} gives: h ′ ( x ) = f ′ ( x ) − g ′ ( x ) h ( x ) g ( x ) = f ′ ( x ) − g ′ ( x ) ⋅ f ( x ) g ( x ) g ( x ) = f ′ ( x ) g ( x ) − f ( x ) g ′ ( x ) g ( x ) 2.

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}h'(x)&={\frac {f'(x)-g'(x)h(x)}{g(x)}}\\&={\frac {f'(x)-g'(x)\cdot {\frac {f(x)}{g(x)}}}{g(x)}}\\&={\frac {f'(x)g(x)-f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^{2}}}.

\end{aligned}}} Proof using the reciprocal rule or chain rule [ edit ] Let h ( x ) = f ( x ) g ( x ) = f ( x ) ⋅ 1 g ( x ).

{\displaystyle h(x)={\frac {f(x)}{g(x)}}=f(x)\cdot {\frac {1}{g(x)}}.

} Then the product rule gives h ′ ( x ) = f ′ ( x ) ⋅ 1 g ( x ) + f ( x ) ⋅ d d x [ 1 g ( x ) ].

{\displaystyle h'(x)=f'(x)\cdot {\frac {1}{g(x)}}+f(x)\cdot {\frac {d}{dx}}\left[{\frac {1}{g(x)}}\right].

} To evaluate the derivative in the second term, apply the reciprocal rule , or the power rule along with the chain rule : d d x [ 1 g ( x ) ] = − 1 g ( x ) 2 ⋅ g ′ ( x ) = − g ′ ( x ) g ( x ) 2.

{\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}\left[{\frac {1}{g(x)}}\right]=-{\frac {1}{g(x)^{2}}}\cdot g'(x)={\frac {-g'(x)}{g(x)^{2}}}.

} Substituting the result into the expression gives h ′ ( x ) = f ′ ( x ) ⋅ 1 g ( x ) + f ( x ) ⋅ [ − g ′ ( x ) g ( x ) 2 ] = f ′ ( x ) g ( x ) − f ( x ) g ′ ( x ) g ( x ) 2 = g ( x ) g ( x ) ⋅ f ′ ( x ) g ( x ) − f ( x ) g ′ ( x ) g ( x ) 2 = f ′ ( x ) g ( x ) − f ( x ) g ′ ( x ) g ( x ) 2.

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}h'(x)&=f'(x)\cdot {\frac {1}{g(x)}}+f(x)\cdot \left[{\frac {-g'(x)}{g(x)^{2}}}\right]\\&={\frac {f'(x)}{g(x)}}-{\frac {f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^{2}}}\\&={\frac {g(x)}{g(x)}}\cdot {\frac {f'(x)}{g(x)}}-{\frac {f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^{2}}}\\&={\frac {f'(x)g(x)-f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^{2}}}.

\end{aligned}}} Proof by logarithmic differentiation [ edit ] Let h ( x ) = f ( x ) g ( x ).

{\displaystyle h(x)={\frac {f(x)}{g(x)}}.

} Taking the absolute value and natural logarithm of both sides of the equation gives ln ⁡ | h ( x ) | = ln ⁡ | f ( x ) g ( x ) | {\displaystyle \ln |h(x)|=\ln \left|{\frac {f(x)}{g(x)}}\right|} Applying properties of the absolute value and logarithms, ln ⁡ | h ( x ) | = ln ⁡ | f ( x ) | − ln ⁡ | g ( x ) | {\displaystyle \ln |h(x)|=\ln |f(x)|-\ln |g(x)|} Taking the logarithmic derivative of both sides, h ′ ( x ) h ( x ) = f ′ ( x ) f ( x ) − g ′ ( x ) g ( x ) {\displaystyle {\frac {h'(x)}{h(x)}}={\frac {f'(x)}{f(x)}}-{\frac {g'(x)}{g(x)}}} Solving for h ′ ( x ) {\displaystyle h'(x)} and substituting back f ( x ) g ( x ) {\displaystyle {\tfrac {f(x)}{g(x)}}} for h ( x ) {\displaystyle h(x)} gives: h ′ ( x ) = h ( x ) [ f ′ ( x ) f ( x ) − g ′ ( x ) g ( x ) ] = f ( x ) g ( x ) [ f ′ ( x ) f ( x ) − g ′ ( x ) g ( x ) ] = f ′ ( x ) g ( x ) − f ( x ) g ′ ( x ) g ( x ) 2 = f ′ ( x ) g ( x ) − f ( x ) g ′ ( x ) g ( x ) 2.

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}h'(x)&=h(x)\left[{\frac {f'(x)}{f(x)}}-{\frac {g'(x)}{g(x)}}\right]\\&={\frac {f(x)}{g(x)}}\left[{\frac {f'(x)}{f(x)}}-{\frac {g'(x)}{g(x)}}\right]\\&={\frac {f'(x)}{g(x)}}-{\frac {f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^{2}}}\\&={\frac {f'(x)g(x)-f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^{2}}}.

\end{aligned}}} Taking the absolute value of the functions is necessary for the logarithmic differentiation of functions that may have negative values, as logarithms are only real-valued for positive arguments.

This works because d d x ( ln ⁡ | u | ) = u ′ u {\displaystyle {\tfrac {d}{dx}}(\ln |u|)={\tfrac {u'}{u}}} , which justifies taking the absolute value of the functions for logarithmic differentiation.

Higher order derivatives [ edit ] Implicit differentiation can be used to compute the n th derivative of a quotient (partially in terms of its first n − 1 derivatives).

For example, differentiating f = g h {\displaystyle f=gh} twice (resulting in f ″ = g ″ h + 2 g ′ h ′ + g h ″ {\displaystyle f''=g''h+2g'h'+gh''} ) and then solving for h ″ {\displaystyle h''} yields h ″ = ( f g ) ″ = f ″ − g ″ h − 2 g ′ h ′ g.

{\displaystyle h''=\left({\frac {f}{g}}\right)''={\frac {f''-g''h-2g'h'}{g}}.
