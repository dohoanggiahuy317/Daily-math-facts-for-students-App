Tip of the day Using Math When using math in an article, there are two different types of markup that one can use.

It is important to be consistent throughout an article and use the same type of markup.

If a formula appears all on the same line, it would be better to use HTML than LaTeX, because L â looks better in line than L â {\displaystyle L^{\infty }} does; however it's generally a bad idea to attempt to render Q ( x ) = 1 2 Ï â« x â e â t 2 / 2 d t = 1 2 erfc âĄ ( x 2 ) , Â x â„ 0 {\displaystyle Q(x)={\frac {1}{\sqrt {2\pi }}}\int _{x}^{\infty }e^{-t^{2}/2}dt={\frac {1}{2}}\,\operatorname {erfc} \left({\frac {x}{\sqrt {2}}}\right),\ x\geq {}0} in HTML.
