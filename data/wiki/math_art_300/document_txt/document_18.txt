It is a generalization of the Riemann and Lebesgue integrals.

It is named after Aleksandr Khinchin and Arnaud Denjoy , but is not to be confused with the (narrow) Denjoy integral.

Motivation [ edit ] If g : I → R is a Lebesgue-integrable function on some interval I = [ a , b ], and if f ( x ) = ∫ a x g ( t ) d t {\displaystyle f(x)=\int _{a}^{x}g(t)\,dt} is its indefinite Lebesgue integral, then the following assertions are true: [1] f is absolutely continuous (see below) f is differentiable almost everywhere Its derivative coincides almost everywhere with g ( x ).

(In fact, all absolutely continuous functions are obtained in this manner.

[2] ) The Lebesgue integral could be defined as follows: g is Lebesgue-integrable on I iff there exists a function f that is absolutely continuous whose derivative coincides with g almost everywhere.

However, even if f : I → R is differentiable everywhere , and g is its derivative, it does not follow that f is ( up to a constant) the Lebesgue indefinite integral of g , simply because g can fail to be Lebesgue-integrable, i.

e.

, f can fail to be absolutely continuous.

An example of this is given [3] by the derivative g of the (differentiable but not absolutely continuous) function f ( x ) = x 2 ·sin(1/ x 2 ) (the function g is not Lebesgue-integrable around 0).

The Denjoy integral corrects this lack by ensuring that the derivative of any function f that is everywhere differentiable (or even differentiable everywhere except for at most countably many points) is integrable, and its integral reconstructs f up to a constant; the Khinchin integral is even more general in that it can integrate the approximate derivative of an approximately differentiable function (see below for definitions).

To do this, one first finds a condition that is weaker than absolute continuity but is satisfied by any approximately differentiable function.

This is the concept of generalized absolute continuity; generalized absolutely continuous functions will be exactly those functions which are indefinite Khinchin integrals.

Definition [ edit ] Generalized absolutely continuous function [ edit ] Let I = [ a , b ] be an interval and f : I → R be a real -valued function on I.

Recall that f is absolutely continuous on a subset E of I if and only if for every positive number ε there is a positive number δ such that whenever a finite collection [ x k , y k ] {\displaystyle [x_{k},y_{k}]} of pairwise disjoint subintervals of I with endpoints in E satisfies ∑ k | y k − x k | < δ {\displaystyle \sum _{k}\left|y_{k}-x_{k}\right|<\delta } it also satisfies ∑ k | f ( y k ) − f ( x k ) | < ε.

{\displaystyle \sum _{k}|f(y_{k})-f(x_{k})|<\varepsilon.

} Define [4] [5] the function f to be generalized absolutely continuous on a subset E of I if the restriction of f to E is continuous (on E ) and E can be written as a countable union of subsets E i such that f is absolutely continuous on each E i.

This is equivalent [6] to the statement that every nonempty perfect subset of E contains a portion [7] on which f is absolutely continuous.

Approximate derivative [ edit ] Let E be a Lebesgue measurable set of reals.

Recall that a real number x (not necessarily in E ) is said to be a point of density of E when lim ε → 0 μ ( E ∩ [ x − ε , x + ε ] ) 2 ε = 1 {\displaystyle \lim _{\varepsilon \to 0}{\frac {\mu (E\cap [x-\varepsilon ,x+\varepsilon ])}{2\varepsilon }}=1} (where μ denotes Lebesgue measure).

A Lebesgue-measurable function g : E → R is said to have approximate limit [8] y at x (a point of density of E ) if for every positive number ε , the point x is a point of density of g − 1 ( [ y − ε , y + ε ] ) {\displaystyle g^{-1}([y-\varepsilon ,y+\varepsilon ])}.

(If furthermore g ( x ) = y , we can say that g is approximately continuous at x.

[9] ) Equivalently, g has approximate limit y at x if and only if there exists a measurable subset F of E such that x is a point of density of F and the (usual) limit at x of the restriction of f to F is y.

Just like the usual limit, the approximate limit is unique if it exists.

Finally, a Lebesgue-measurable function f : E → R is said to have approximate derivative y at x iff f ( x ′ ) − f ( x ) x ′ − x {\displaystyle {\frac {f(x')-f(x)}{x'-x}}} has approximate limit y at x ; this implies that f is approximately continuous at x.

A theorem [ edit ] Recall that it follows from Lusin's theorem that a Lebesgue-measurable function is approximately continuous almost everywhere (and conversely ).

[10] [11] The key theorem in constructing the Khinchin integral is this: a function f that is generalized absolutely continuous (or even of "generalized bounded variation", a weaker notion) has an approximate derivative almost everywhere.

[12] [13] [14] Furthermore, if f is generalized absolutely continuous and its approximate derivative is nonnegative almost everywhere, then f is nondecreasing , [15] and consequently, if this approximate derivative is zero almost everywhere, then f is constant.

The Khinchin integral [ edit ] Let I = [ a , b ] be an interval and g : I → R be a real-valued function on I.

The function g is said to be Khinchin-integrable on I iff there exists a function f that is generalized absolutely continuous whose approximate derivative coincides with g almost everywhere; [16] in this case, the function f is determined by g up to a constant, and the Khinchin-integral of g from a to b is defined as f ( b ) − f ( a ) {\displaystyle f(b)-f(a)}.

A particular case [ edit ] If f : I → R is continuous and has an approximate derivative everywhere on I except for at most countably many points, then f is, in fact, generalized absolutely continuous, so it is the (indefinite) Khinchin-integral of its approximate derivative.

[17] This result does not hold if the set of points where f is not assumed to have an approximate derivative is merely of Lebesgue measure zero , as the Cantor function shows.
