It is published ten times each year by Taylor & Francis for the Mathematical Association of America.

The American Mathematical Monthly is an expository journal intended for a wide audience of mathematicians, from undergraduate students to research professionals.

Articles are chosen on the basis of their broad interest and reviewed and edited for quality of exposition as well as content.

In this the American Mathematical Monthly fulfills a different role from that of typical mathematical research journals.

The American Mathematical Monthly is the most widely read mathematics journal in the world, according to records on JSTOR.

[2] [3] Tables of contents with article abstracts from 1997–2010 are available online.

The MAA gives the Lester R.

Ford Awards annually to "authors of articles of expository excellence" published in the American Mathematical Monthly.
