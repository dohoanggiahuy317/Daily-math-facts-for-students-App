Bos describes it as the principle to the effect that in a sum involving infinitesimals of different orders, only the lowest-order term must be retained, and the remainder discarded.

[2] Thus, if a {\displaystyle a} is finite and d x {\displaystyle dx} is infinitesimal, then one sets a + d x = a.

{\displaystyle a+dx=a.

} Similarly, u d v + v d u + d u d v = u d v + v d u , {\displaystyle u\,dv+v\,du+du\,dv=u\,dv+v\,du,} where the higher-order term du dv is discarded in accordance with the TLH.

A recent study argues that Leibniz's TLH was a precursor of the standard part function over the hyperreals.
