Although the function ⁠ sin ⁡ x x {\displaystyle {\tfrac {\sin x}{x}}} ⁠ is not defined at zero, as x becomes closer and closer to zero, ⁠ sin ⁡ x x {\displaystyle {\tfrac {\sin x}{x}}} ⁠ becomes arbitrarily close to 1.

In other words, the limit of ⁠ sin ⁡ x x , {\displaystyle {\tfrac {\sin x}{x}},} ⁠ as x approaches zero, equals 1.

Formal definitions, first devised in the early 19th century, are given below.

Informally, a function f assigns an output f ( x ) to every input x.

We say that the function has a limit L at an input p , if f ( x ) gets closer and closer to L as x moves closer and closer to p.

More specifically, the output value can be made arbitrarily close to L if the input to f is taken sufficiently close to p.

On the other hand, if some inputs very close to p are taken to outputs that stay a fixed distance apart, then we say the limit does not exist.

The notion of a limit has many applications in modern calculus.

In particular, the many definitions of continuity employ the concept of limit: roughly, a function is continuous if all of its limits agree with the values of the function.

The concept of limit also appears in the definition of the derivative : in the calculus of one variable, this is the limiting value of the slope of secant lines to the graph of a function.

History [ edit ] Although implicit in the development of calculus of the 17th and 18th centuries, the modern idea of the limit of a function goes back to Bolzano who, in 1817, introduced the basics of the epsilon-delta technique (see (ε, δ)-definition of limit below) to define continuous functions.

However, his work was not known during his lifetime.

[1] In his 1821 book Cours d'analyse , Augustin-Louis Cauchy discussed variable quantities, infinitesimals and limits, and defined continuity of y = f ( x ) {\displaystyle y=f(x)} by saying that an infinitesimal change in x necessarily produces an infinitesimal change in y , while Grabiner claims that he used a rigorous epsilon-delta definition in proofs.

[2] In 1861, Weierstrass first introduced the epsilon-delta definition of limit in the form it is usually written today.

[3] He also introduced the notations lim {\textstyle \lim } and lim x → x 0.

{\textstyle \textstyle \lim _{x\to x_{0}}\displaystyle.

} [4] The modern notation of placing the arrow below the limit symbol is due to Hardy , which is introduced in his book A Course of Pure Mathematics in 1908.

[5] Motivation [ edit ] Imagine a person walking on a landscape represented by the graph y = f ( x ).

Their horizontal position is given by x , much like the position given by a map of the land or by a global positioning system.

Their altitude is given by the coordinate y.

Suppose they walk towards a position x = p , as they get closer and closer to this point, they will notice that their altitude approaches a specific value L.

If asked about the altitude corresponding to x = p , they would reply by saying y = L.

What, then, does it mean to say, their altitude is approaching L ? It means that their altitude gets nearer and nearer to L —except for a possible small error in accuracy.

For example, suppose we set a particular accuracy goal for our traveler: they must get within ten meters of L.

They report back that indeed, they can get within ten vertical meters of L , arguing that as long as they are within fifty horizontal meters of p , their altitude is always within ten meters of L.

The accuracy goal is then changed: can they get within one vertical meter? Yes, supposing that they are able to move within five horizontal meters of p , their altitude will always remain within one meter from the target altitude L.

Summarizing the aforementioned concept we can say that the traveler's altitude approaches L as their horizontal position approaches p , so as to say that for every target accuracy goal, however small it may be, there is some neighbourhood of p where all (not just some) altitudes correspond to all the horizontal positions, except maybe the horizontal position p itself, in that neighbourhood fulfill that accuracy goal.

The initial informal statement can now be explicated: The limit of a function f ( x ) as x approaches p is a number L with the following property: given any target distance from L , there is a distance from p within which the values of f ( x ) remain within the target distance.

In fact, this explicit statement is quite close to the formal definition of the limit of a function, with values in a topological space.

More specifically, to say that lim x → p f ( x ) = L , {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to p}f(x)=L,} is to say that f ( x ) can be made as close to L as desired, by making x close enough, but not equal, to p.

The following definitions, known as ( ε , δ ) -definitions, are the generally accepted definitions for the limit of a function in various contexts.

Functions of a single variable [ edit ] ( ε , δ ) -definition of limit [ edit ] For the depicted f , a , and b , we can ensure that the value f ( x ) is within an arbitrarily small interval ( b – ε, b + ε) by restricting x to a sufficiently small interval ( a – δ, a + δ).

Hence f ( x ) → b as x → a.

Suppose f : R → R {\displaystyle f:\mathbb {R} \rightarrow \mathbb {R} } is a function defined on the real line , and there are two real numbers p and L.

One would say that the limit of f , as x approaches p , is L and written [6] lim x → p f ( x ) = L , {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to p}f(x)=L,} or alternatively, say f ( x ) tends to L as x tends to p , and written: f ( x ) → L as x → p , {\displaystyle f(x)\to L{\text{ as }}x\to p,} if the following property holds: for every real ε > 0 , there exists a real δ > 0 such that for all real x , 0 < | x − p | < δ implies | f ( x ) − L | < ε.

[6] Symbolically, ( ∀ ε > 0 ) ( ∃ δ > 0 ) ( ∀ x ∈ R ) ( 0 < | x − p | < δ ⟹ | f ( x ) − L | < ε ).

{\displaystyle (\forall \varepsilon >0)\,(\exists \delta >0)\,(\forall x\in \mathbb {R} )\,(0<|x-p|<\delta \implies |f(x)-L|<\varepsilon ).

} For example, we may say lim x → 2 ( 4 x + 1 ) = 9 {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 2}(4x+1)=9} because for every real ε > 0 , we can take δ = ε /4 , so that for all real x , if 0 < | x − 2 | < δ , then | 4 x + 1 − 9 | < ε.

A more general definition applies for functions defined on subsets of the real line.

Let S be a subset of ⁠ R.

{\displaystyle \mathbb {R}.

} ⁠ Let f : S → R {\displaystyle f:S\to \mathbb {R} } be a real-valued function.

Let p be a point such that there exists some open interval ( a , b ) containing p with ( a , p ) ∪ ( p , b ) ⊂ S.

{\displaystyle (a,p)\cup (p,b)\subset S.

} It is then said that the limit of f as x approaches p is L , if: For every real ε > 0 , there exists a real δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ ( a , b ) , 0 < | x − p | < δ implies that | f ( x ) − L | < ε.

Or, symbolically: ( ∀ ε > 0 ) ( ∃ δ > 0 ) ( ∀ x ∈ ( a , b ) ) ( 0 < | x − p | < δ ⟹ | f ( x ) − L | < ε ).

{\displaystyle (\forall \varepsilon >0)\,(\exists \delta >0)\,(\forall x\in (a,b))\,(0<|x-p|<\delta \implies |f(x)-L|<\varepsilon ).

} For example, we may say lim x → 1 x + 3 = 2 {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 1}{\sqrt {x+3}}=2} because for every real ε > 0 , we can take δ = ε , so that for all real x ≥ −3 , if 0 < | x − 1 | < δ , then | f ( x ) − 2 | < ε.

In this example, S = [−3, ∞) contains open intervals around the point 1 (for example, the interval (0, 2)).

Here, note that the value of the limit does not depend on f being defined at p , nor on the value f ( p ) —if it is defined.

For example, let f : [ 0 , 1 ) ∪ ( 1 , 2 ] → R , f ( x ) = 2 x 2 − x − 1 x − 1.

{\displaystyle f:[0,1)\cup (1,2]\to \mathbb {R} ,f(x)={\tfrac {2x^{2}-x-1}{x-1}}.

} lim x → 1 f ( x ) = 3 {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 1}f(x)=3} because for every ε > 0 , we can take δ = ε /2 , so that for all real x ≠ 1 , if 0 < | x − 1 | < δ , then | f ( x ) − 3 | < ε.

Note that here f (1) is undefined.

In fact, a limit can exist in { x ∈ R | ∃ ( a , b ) ⊂ R p ∈ ( a , b ) and ( a , p ) ∪ ( p , b ) ⊂ S } , {\displaystyle \{x\in \mathbb {R} \,|\,\exists (a,b)\subset \mathbb {R} \quad p\in (a,b){\text{ and }}(a,p)\cup (p,b)\subset S\},} which equals int ⁡ S ∪ iso ⁡ S c , {\displaystyle \operatorname {int} S\cup \operatorname {iso} S^{c},} where int S is the interior of S , and iso S c are the isolated points of the complement of S.

In our previous example where S = [ 0 , 1 ) ∪ ( 1 , 2 ] , {\displaystyle S=[0,1)\cup (1,2],} int ⁡ S = ( 0 , 1 ) ∪ ( 1 , 2 ) , {\displaystyle \operatorname {int} S=(0,1)\cup (1,2),} iso ⁡ S c = { 1 }.

{\displaystyle \operatorname {iso} S^{c}=\{1\}.

} We see, specifically, this definition of limit allows a limit to exist at 1, but not 0 or 2.

The letters ε and δ can be understood as "error" and "distance".

In fact, Cauchy used ε as an abbreviation for "error" in some of his work, [2] though in his definition of continuity, he used an infinitesimal α {\displaystyle \alpha } rather than either ε or δ (see Cours d'Analyse ).

In these terms, the error ( ε ) in the measurement of the value at the limit can be made as small as desired, by reducing the distance ( δ ) to the limit point.

As discussed below, this definition also works for functions in a more general context.

The idea that δ and ε represent distances helps suggest these generalizations.

Existence and one-sided limits [ edit ] Main article: One-sided limit The limit as x → x 0 + {\displaystyle x\to x_{0}^{+}} differs from that as x → x 0 −.

{\displaystyle x\to x_{0}^{-}.

} Therefore, the limit as x → x 0 does not exist.

Alternatively, x may approach p from above (right) or below (left), in which case the limits may be written as lim x → p + f ( x ) = L {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to p^{+}}f(x)=L} or lim x → p − f ( x ) = L {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to p^{-}}f(x)=L} The first three functions have points for which the limit does not exist, while the function f ( x ) = sin ⁡ ( x ) x {\displaystyle f(x)={\frac {\sin(x)}{x}}} is not defined at x = 0 {\displaystyle x=0} , but its limit does exist.

respectively.

If these limits exist at p and are equal there, then this can be referred to as the limit of f ( x ) at p.

[7] If the one-sided limits exist at p , but are unequal, then there is no limit at p (i.

e.

, the limit at p does not exist).

If either one-sided limit does not exist at p , then the limit at p also does not exist.

A formal definition is as follows.

The limit of f as x approaches p from above is L if: For every ε > 0 , there exists a δ > 0 such that whenever 0 < x − p < δ , we have | f ( x ) − L | < ε.

( ∀ ε > 0 ) ( ∃ δ > 0 ) ( ∀ x ∈ ( a , b ) ) ( 0 < x − p < δ ⟹ | f ( x ) − L | < ε ).

{\displaystyle (\forall \varepsilon >0)\,(\exists \delta >0)\,(\forall x\in (a,b))\,(0<x-p<\delta \implies |f(x)-L|<\varepsilon ).

} The limit of f as x approaches p from below is L if: For every ε > 0 , there exists a δ > 0 such that whenever 0 < p − x < δ , we have | f ( x ) − L | < ε.

( ∀ ε > 0 ) ( ∃ δ > 0 ) ( ∀ x ∈ ( a , b ) ) ( 0 < p − x < δ ⟹ | f ( x ) − L | < ε ).

{\displaystyle (\forall \varepsilon >0)\,(\exists \delta >0)\,(\forall x\in (a,b))\,(0<p-x<\delta \implies |f(x)-L|<\varepsilon ).

} If the limit does not exist, then the oscillation of f at p is non-zero.

More general definition using limit points and subsets [ edit ] Further information: Limit point Limits can also be defined by approaching from subsets of the domain.

In general: [8] Let f : S → R {\displaystyle f:S\to \mathbb {R} } be a real-valued function defined on some S ⊆ R.

{\displaystyle S\subseteq \mathbb {R}.

} Let p be a limit point of some T ⊂ S {\displaystyle T\subset S} —that is, p is the limit of some sequence of elements of T distinct from p.

Then we say the limit of f , as x approaches p from values in T , is L , written lim x → p x ∈ T f ( x ) = L {\displaystyle \lim _{{x\to p} \atop {x\in T}}f(x)=L} if the following holds: For every ε > 0 , there exists a δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ T , 0 < | x − p | < δ implies that | f ( x ) − L | < ε.

( ∀ ε > 0 ) ( ∃ δ > 0 ) ( ∀ x ∈ T ) ( 0 < | x − p | < δ ⟹ | f ( x ) − L | < ε ).

{\displaystyle (\forall \varepsilon >0)\,(\exists \delta >0)\,(\forall x\in T)\,(0<|x-p|<\delta \implies |f(x)-L|<\varepsilon ).

} Note, T can be any subset of S , the domain of f.

And the limit might depend on the selection of T.

This generalization includes as special cases limits on an interval, as well as left-handed limits of real-valued functions (e.

g.

, by taking T to be an open interval of the form (–∞, a ) ), and right-handed limits (e.

g.

, by taking T to be an open interval of the form ( a , ∞) ).

It also extends the notion of one-sided limits to the included endpoints of (half-)closed intervals, so the square root function f ( x ) = x {\displaystyle f(x)={\sqrt {x}}} can have limit 0 as x approaches 0 from above: lim x → 0 x ∈ [ 0 , ∞ ) x = 0 {\displaystyle \lim _{{x\to 0} \atop {x\in [0,\infty )}}{\sqrt {x}}=0} since for every ε > 0 , we may take δ = ε such that for all x ≥ 0 , if 0 < | x − 0 | < δ , then | f ( x ) − 0 | < ε.

This definition allows a limit to be defined at limit points of the domain S , if a suitable subset T which has the same limit point is chosen.

Notably, the previous two-sided definition works on int ⁡ S ∪ iso ⁡ S c , {\displaystyle \operatorname {int} S\cup \operatorname {iso} S^{c},} which is a subset of the limit points of S.

For example, let S = [ 0 , 1 ) ∪ ( 1 , 2 ].

{\displaystyle S=[0,1)\cup (1,2].

} The previous two-sided definition would work at 1 ∈ iso ⁡ S c = { 1 } , {\displaystyle 1\in \operatorname {iso} S^{c}=\{1\},} but it wouldn't work at 0 or 2, which are limit points of S.

Deleted versus non-deleted limits [ edit ] The definition of limit given here does not depend on how (or whether) f is defined at p.

Bartle [9] refers to this as a deleted limit , because it excludes the value of f at p.

The corresponding non-deleted limit does depend on the value of f at p , if p is in the domain of f.

Let f : S → R {\displaystyle f:S\to \mathbb {R} } be a real-valued function.

The non-deleted limit of f , as x approaches p , is L if For every ε > 0 , there exists a δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ S , | x − p | < δ implies | f ( x ) − L | < ε.

( ∀ ε > 0 ) ( ∃ δ > 0 ) ( ∀ x ∈ S ) ( | x − p | < δ ⟹ | f ( x ) − L | < ε ).

{\displaystyle (\forall \varepsilon >0)\,(\exists \delta >0)\,(\forall x\in S)\,(|x-p|<\delta \implies |f(x)-L|<\varepsilon ).

} The definition is the same, except that the neighborhood | x − p | < δ now includes the point p , in contrast to the deleted neighborhood 0 < | x − p | < δ.

This makes the definition of a non-deleted limit less general.

One of the advantages of working with non-deleted limits is that they allow to state the theorem about limits of compositions without any constraints on the functions (other than the existence of their non-deleted limits).

[10] Bartle [9] notes that although by "limit" some authors do mean this non-deleted limit, deleted limits are the most popular.

[11] Examples [ edit ] Non-existence of one-sided limit(s) [ edit ] Function without a limit at an essential discontinuity The function f ( x ) = { sin ⁡ 5 x − 1 for x < 1 0 for x = 1 1 10 x − 10 for x > 1 {\displaystyle f(x)={\begin{cases}\sin {\frac {5}{x-1}}&{\text{ for }}x<1\\0&{\text{ for }}x=1\\[2pt]{\frac {1}{10x-10}}&{\text{ for }}x>1\end{cases}}} has no limit at x 0 = 1 (the left-hand limit does not exist due to the oscillatory nature of the sine function, and the right-hand limit does not exist due to the asymptotic behaviour of the reciprocal function, see picture), but has a limit at every other x -coordinate.

The function f ( x ) = { 1 x rational 0 x irrational {\displaystyle f(x)={\begin{cases}1&x{\text{ rational }}\\0&x{\text{ irrational }}\end{cases}}} (a.

k.

a.

, the Dirichlet function ) has no limit at any x -coordinate.

Non-equality of one-sided limits [ edit ] The function f ( x ) = { 1 for x < 0 2 for x ≥ 0 {\displaystyle f(x)={\begin{cases}1&{\text{ for }}x<0\\2&{\text{ for }}x\geq 0\end{cases}}} has a limit at every non-zero x -coordinate (the limit equals 1 for negative x and equals 2 for positive x ).

The limit at x = 0 does not exist (the left-hand limit equals 1, whereas the right-hand limit equals 2).

Limits at only one point [ edit ] The functions f ( x ) = { x x rational 0 x irrational {\displaystyle f(x)={\begin{cases}x&x{\text{ rational }}\\0&x{\text{ irrational }}\end{cases}}} and f ( x ) = { | x | x rational 0 x irrational {\displaystyle f(x)={\begin{cases}|x|&x{\text{ rational }}\\0&x{\text{ irrational }}\end{cases}}} both have a limit at x = 0 and it equals 0.

Limits at countably many points [ edit ] The function f ( x ) = { sin ⁡ x x irrational 1 x rational {\displaystyle f(x)={\begin{cases}\sin x&x{\text{ irrational }}\\1&x{\text{ rational }}\end{cases}}} has a limit at any x -coordinate of the form π 2 + 2 n π , {\displaystyle {\tfrac {\pi }{2}}+2n\pi ,} where n is any integer.

Limits involving infinity [ edit ] Limits at infinity [ edit ] The limit of this function at infinity exists Let f : S → R {\displaystyle f:S\to \mathbb {R} } be a function defined on S ⊆ R.

{\displaystyle S\subseteq \mathbb {R}.

} The limit of f as x approaches infinity is L , denoted lim x → ∞ f ( x ) = L , {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to \infty }f(x)=L,} means that: For every ε > 0 , there exists a c > 0 such that whenever + x > c , we have | f ( x ) − L | < ε.

( ∀ ε > 0 ) ( ∃ c > 0 ) ( ∀ x ∈ S ) ( x > c ⟹ | f ( x ) − L | < ε ).

{\displaystyle (\forall \varepsilon >0)\,(\exists c>0)\,(\forall x\in S)\,(x>c\implies |f(x)-L|<\varepsilon ).

} Similarly, the limit of f as x approaches minus infinity is L , denoted lim x → − ∞ f ( x ) = L , {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to -\infty }f(x)=L,} means that: For every ε > 0 , there exists a c > 0 such that whenever x < − c , we have | f ( x ) − L | < ε.

( ∀ ε > 0 ) ( ∃ c > 0 ) ( ∀ x ∈ S ) ( x < − c ⟹ | f ( x ) − L | < ε ).

{\displaystyle (\forall \varepsilon >0)\,(\exists c>0)\,(\forall x\in S)\,(x<-c\implies |f(x)-L|<\varepsilon ).

} For example, lim x → ∞ ( − 3 sin ⁡ x x + 4 ) = 4 {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to \infty }\left(-{\frac {3\sin x}{x}}+4\right)=4} because for every ε > 0 , we can take c = 3/ ε such that for all real x , if x > c , then | f ( x ) − 4 | < ε.

Another example is that lim x → − ∞ e x = 0 {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to -\infty }e^{x}=0} because for every ε > 0 , we can take c = max{1, −ln( ε )} such that for all real x , if x < − c , then | f ( x ) − 0 | < ε.

Infinite limits [ edit ] For a function whose values grow without bound, the function diverges and the usual limit does not exist.

However, in this case one may introduce limits with infinite values.

Let f : S → R {\displaystyle f:S\to \mathbb {R} } be a function defined on S ⊆ R.

{\displaystyle S\subseteq \mathbb {R}.

} The statement the limit of f as x approaches p is infinity , denoted lim x → p f ( x ) = ∞ , {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to p}f(x)=\infty ,} means that: For every N > 0 , there exists a δ > 0 such that whenever 0 < | x − p | < δ , we have f ( x ) > N.

( ∀ N > 0 ) ( ∃ δ > 0 ) ( ∀ x ∈ S ) ( 0 < | x − p | < δ ⟹ f ( x ) > N ).

{\displaystyle (\forall N>0)\,(\exists \delta >0)\,(\forall x\in S)\,(0<|x-p|<\delta \implies f(x)>N).

} The statement the limit of f as x approaches p is minus infinity , denoted lim x → p f ( x ) = − ∞ , {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to p}f(x)=-\infty ,} means that: For every N > 0 , there exists a δ > 0 such that whenever 0 < | x − p | < δ , we have f ( x ) < − N.

( ∀ N > 0 ) ( ∃ δ > 0 ) ( ∀ x ∈ S ) ( 0 < | x − p | < δ ⟹ f ( x ) < − N ).

{\displaystyle (\forall N>0)\,(\exists \delta >0)\,(\forall x\in S)\,(0<|x-p|<\delta \implies f(x)<-N).

} For example, lim x → 1 1 ( x − 1 ) 2 = ∞ {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 1}{\frac {1}{(x-1)^{2}}}=\infty } because for every N > 0 , we can take δ = 1 N δ = 1 N {\textstyle \delta ={\tfrac {1}{{\sqrt {N}}\delta }}={\tfrac {1}{\sqrt {N}}}} such that for all real x > 0 , if 0 < x − 1 < δ , then f ( x ) > N.

These ideas can be used together to produce definitions for different combinations, such as lim x → ∞ f ( x ) = ∞ , {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to \infty }f(x)=\infty ,} or lim x → p + f ( x ) = − ∞.

{\displaystyle \lim _{x\to p^{+}}f(x)=-\infty.

} For example, lim x → 0 + ln ⁡ x = − ∞ {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0^{+}}\ln x=-\infty } because for every N > 0 , we can take δ = e − N such that for all real x > 0 , if 0 < x − 0 < δ , then f ( x ) < − N.

Limits involving infinity are connected with the concept of asymptotes.

These notions of a limit attempt to provide a metric space interpretation to limits at infinity.

In fact, they are consistent with the topological space definition of limit if a neighborhood of −∞ is defined to contain an interval [−∞, c ) for some ⁠ c ∈ R , {\displaystyle c\in \mathbb {R} ,} ⁠ a neighborhood of ∞ is defined to contain an interval ( c , ∞] where ⁠ c ∈ R , {\displaystyle c\in \mathbb {R} ,} ⁠ and a neighborhood of ⁠ a ∈ R {\displaystyle a\in \mathbb {R} } ⁠ is defined in the normal way metric space ⁠ R.

{\displaystyle \mathbb {R}.

} ⁠ In this case, ⁠ R ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {\mathbb {R} }}} ⁠ is a topological space and any function of the form f : X → Y {\displaystyle f:X\to Y} with X , Y ⊆ R ¯ {\displaystyle X,Y\subseteq {\overline {\mathbb {R} }}} is subject to the topological definition of a limit.

Note that with this topological definition, it is easy to define infinite limits at finite points, which have not been defined above in the metric sense.

Alternative notation [ edit ] Many authors [12] allow for the projectively extended real line to be used as a way to include infinite values as well as extended real line.

With this notation, the extended real line is given as ⁠ R ∪ { − ∞ , + ∞ } {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} \cup \{-\infty ,+\infty \}} ⁠ and the projectively extended real line is ⁠ R ∪ { ∞ } {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} \cup \{\infty \}} ⁠ where a neighborhood of ∞ is a set of the form { x : | x | > c }.

{\displaystyle \{x:|x|>c\}.

} The advantage is that one only needs three definitions for limits (left, right, and central) to cover all the cases.

As presented above, for a completely rigorous account, we would need to consider 15 separate cases for each combination of infinities (five directions: −∞, left, central, right, and +∞; three bounds: −∞, finite, or +∞).

There are also noteworthy pitfalls.

For example, when working with the extended real line, x − 1 {\displaystyle x^{-1}} does not possess a central limit (which is normal): lim x → 0 + 1 x = + ∞ , lim x → 0 − 1 x = − ∞.

{\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0^{+}}{1 \over x}=+\infty ,\quad \lim _{x\to 0^{-}}{1 \over x}=-\infty.

} In contrast, when working with the projective real line, infinities (much like 0) are unsigned, so, the central limit does exist in that context: lim x → 0 + 1 x = lim x → 0 − 1 x = lim x → 0 1 x = ∞.

{\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0^{+}}{1 \over x}=\lim _{x\to 0^{-}}{1 \over x}=\lim _{x\to 0}{1 \over x}=\infty.

} In fact there are a plethora of conflicting formal systems in use.

In certain applications of numerical differentiation and integration , it is, for example, convenient to have signed zeroes.

A simple reason has to do with the converse of lim x → 0 − x − 1 = − ∞ , {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0^{-}}{x^{-1}}=-\infty ,} namely, it is convenient for lim x → − ∞ x − 1 = − 0 {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to -\infty }{x^{-1}}=-0} to be considered true.

Such zeroes can be seen as an approximation to infinitesimals.

Limits at infinity for rational functions [ edit ] Horizontal asymptote about y = 4 There are three basic rules for evaluating limits at infinity for a rational function f ( x ) = p ( x ) q ( x ) {\displaystyle f(x)={\tfrac {p(x)}{q(x)}}} (where p and q are polynomials): If the degree of p is greater than the degree of q , then the limit is positive or negative infinity depending on the signs of the leading coefficients; If the degree of p and q are equal, the limit is the leading coefficient of p divided by the leading coefficient of q ; If the degree of p is less than the degree of q , the limit is 0.

If the limit at infinity exists, it represents a horizontal asymptote at y = L.

Polynomials do not have horizontal asymptotes; such asymptotes may however occur with rational functions.

Functions of more than one variable [ edit ] Ordinary limits [ edit ] By noting that | x − p | represents a distance , the definition of a limit can be extended to functions of more than one variable.

In the case of a function f : S × T → R {\displaystyle f:S\times T\to \mathbb {R} } defined on S × T ⊆ R 2 , {\displaystyle S\times T\subseteq \mathbb {R} ^{2},} we defined the limit as follows: the limit of f as ( x , y ) approaches ( p , q ) is L , written lim ( x , y ) → ( p , q ) f ( x , y ) = L {\displaystyle \lim _{(x,y)\to (p,q)}f(x,y)=L} if the following condition holds: For every ε > 0 , there exists a δ > 0 such that for all x in S and y in T , whenever 0 < ( x − p ) 2 + ( y − q ) 2 < δ , {\textstyle 0<{\sqrt {(x-p)^{2}+(y-q)^{2}}}<\delta ,} we have | f ( x , y ) − L | < ε , [13] or formally: ( ∀ ε > 0 ) ( ∃ δ > 0 ) ( ∀ x ∈ S ) ( ∀ y ∈ T ) ( 0 < ( x − p ) 2 + ( y − q ) 2 < δ ⟹ | f ( x , y ) − L | < ε ) ).

{\displaystyle (\forall \varepsilon >0)\,(\exists \delta >0)\,(\forall x\in S)\,(\forall y\in T)\,(0<{\sqrt {(x-p)^{2}+(y-q)^{2}}}<\delta \implies |f(x,y)-L|<\varepsilon )).

} Here ( x − p ) 2 + ( y − q ) 2 {\textstyle {\sqrt {(x-p)^{2}+(y-q)^{2}}}} is the Euclidean distance between ( x , y ) and ( p , q ).

(This can in fact be replaced by any norm | | ( x , y ) − ( p , q ) | | , and be extended to any number of variables.

) For example, we may say lim ( x , y ) → ( 0 , 0 ) x 4 x 2 + y 2 = 0 {\displaystyle \lim _{(x,y)\to (0,0)}{\frac {x^{4}}{x^{2}+y^{2}}}=0} because for every ε > 0 , we can take δ = ε {\textstyle \delta ={\sqrt {\varepsilon }}} such that for all real x ≠ 0 and real y ≠ 0 , if 0 < ( x − 0 ) 2 + ( y − 0 ) 2 < δ , {\textstyle 0<{\sqrt {(x-0)^{2}+(y-0)^{2}}}<\delta ,} then | f ( x , y ) − 0 | < ε.

Similar to the case in single variable, the value of f at ( p , q ) does not matter in this definition of limit.

For such a multivariable limit to exist, this definition requires the value of f approaches L along every possible path approaching ( p , q ).

[14] In the above example, the function f ( x , y ) = x 4 x 2 + y 2 {\displaystyle f(x,y)={\frac {x^{4}}{x^{2}+y^{2}}}} satisfies this condition.

This can be seen by considering the polar coordinates ( x , y ) = ( r cos ⁡ θ , r sin ⁡ θ ) → ( 0 , 0 ) , {\displaystyle (x,y)=(r\cos \theta ,r\sin \theta )\to (0,0),} which gives lim r → 0 f ( r cos ⁡ θ , r sin ⁡ θ ) = lim r → 0 r 4 cos 4 ⁡ θ r 2 = lim r → 0 r 2 cos 4 ⁡ θ.

{\displaystyle \lim _{r\to 0}f(r\cos \theta ,r\sin \theta )=\lim _{r\to 0}{\frac {r^{4}\cos ^{4}\theta }{r^{2}}}=\lim _{r\to 0}r^{2}\cos ^{4}\theta.

} Here θ = θ ( r ) is a function of r which controls the shape of the path along which f is approaching ( p , q ).

Since cos θ is bounded between [−1, 1], by the sandwich theorem , this limit tends to 0.

In contrast, the function f ( x , y ) = x y x 2 + y 2 {\displaystyle f(x,y)={\frac {xy}{x^{2}+y^{2}}}} does not have a limit at (0, 0).

Taking the path ( x , y ) = ( t , 0) → (0, 0) , we obtain lim t → 0 f ( t , 0 ) = lim t → 0 0 t 2 = 0 , {\displaystyle \lim _{t\to 0}f(t,0)=\lim _{t\to 0}{\frac {0}{t^{2}}}=0,} while taking the path ( x , y ) = ( t , t ) → (0, 0) , we obtain lim t → 0 f ( t , t ) = lim t → 0 t 2 t 2 + t 2 = 1 2.

{\displaystyle \lim _{t\to 0}f(t,t)=\lim _{t\to 0}{\frac {t^{2}}{t^{2}+t^{2}}}={\frac {1}{2}}.

} Since the two values do not agree, f does not tend to a single value as ( x , y ) approaches (0, 0).

Multiple limits [ edit ] Although less commonly used, there is another type of limit for a multivariable function, known as the multiple limit.

For a two-variable function, this is the double limit.

[15] Let f : S × T → R {\displaystyle f:S\times T\to \mathbb {R} } be defined on S × T ⊆ R 2 , {\displaystyle S\times T\subseteq \mathbb {R} ^{2},} we say the double limit of f as x approaches p and y approaches q is L , written lim x → p y → q f ( x , y ) = L {\displaystyle \lim _{{x\to p} \atop {y\to q}}f(x,y)=L} if the following condition holds: For every ε > 0 , there exists a δ > 0 such that for all x in S and y in T , whenever 0 < | x − p | < δ and 0 < | y − q | < δ , we have | f ( x , y ) − L | < ε.

[15] ( ∀ ε > 0 ) ( ∃ δ > 0 ) ( ∀ x ∈ S ) ( ∀ y ∈ T ) ( ( 0 < | x − p | < δ ) ∧ ( 0 < | y − q | < δ ) ⟹ | f ( x , y ) − L | < ε ).

{\displaystyle (\forall \varepsilon >0)\,(\exists \delta >0)\,(\forall x\in S)\,(\forall y\in T)\,((0<|x-p|<\delta )\land (0<|y-q|<\delta )\implies |f(x,y)-L|<\varepsilon ).

} For such a double limit to exist, this definition requires the value of f approaches L along every possible path approaching ( p , q ) , excluding the two lines x = p and y = q.

As a result, the multiple limit is a weaker notion than the ordinary limit: if the ordinary limit exists and equals L , then the multiple limit exists and also equals L.

The converse is not true: the existence of the multiple limits does not imply the existence of the ordinary limit.

Consider the example f ( x , y ) = { 1 for x y ≠ 0 0 for x y = 0 {\displaystyle f(x,y)={\begin{cases}1\quad {\text{for}}\quad xy\neq 0\\0\quad {\text{for}}\quad xy=0\end{cases}}} where lim x → 0 y → 0 f ( x , y ) = 1 {\displaystyle \lim _{{x\to 0} \atop {y\to 0}}f(x,y)=1} but lim ( x , y ) → ( 0 , 0 ) f ( x , y ) {\displaystyle \lim _{(x,y)\to (0,0)}f(x,y)} does not exist.

If the domain of f is restricted to ( S ∖ { p } ) × ( T ∖ { q } ) , {\displaystyle (S\setminus \{p\})\times (T\setminus \{q\}),} then the two definitions of limits coincide.

[15] Multiple limits at infinity [ edit ] The concept of multiple limit can extend to the limit at infinity, in a way similar to that of a single variable function.

For f : S × T → R , {\displaystyle f:S\times T\to \mathbb {R} ,} we say the double limit of f as x and y approaches infinity is L , written lim x → ∞ y → ∞ f ( x , y ) = L {\displaystyle \lim _{{x\to \infty } \atop {y\to \infty }}f(x,y)=L} if the following condition holds: For every ε > 0 , there exists a c > 0 such that for all x in S and y in T , whenever x > c and y > c , we have | f ( x , y ) − L | < ε.

( ∀ ε > 0 ) ( ∃ c > 0 ) ( ∀ x ∈ S ) ( ∀ y ∈ T ) ( ( x > c ) ∧ ( y > c ) ⟹ | f ( x , y ) − L | < ε ).

{\displaystyle (\forall \varepsilon >0)\,(\exists c>0)\,(\forall x\in S)\,(\forall y\in T)\,((x>c)\land (y>c)\implies |f(x,y)-L|<\varepsilon ).

} We say the double limit of f as x and y approaches minus infinity is L , written lim x → − ∞ y → − ∞ f ( x , y ) = L {\displaystyle \lim _{{x\to -\infty } \atop {y\to -\infty }}f(x,y)=L} if the following condition holds: For every ε > 0 , there exists a c > 0 such that x in S and y in T , whenever x < − c and y < − c , we have | f ( x , y ) − L | < ε.

( ∀ ε > 0 ) ( ∃ c > 0 ) ( ∀ x ∈ S ) ( ∀ y ∈ T ) ( ( x < − c ) ∧ ( y < − c ) ⟹ | f ( x , y ) − L | < ε ).

{\displaystyle (\forall \varepsilon >0)\,(\exists c>0)\,(\forall x\in S)\,(\forall y\in T)\,((x<-c)\land (y<-c)\implies |f(x,y)-L|<\varepsilon ).

} Pointwise limits and uniform limits [ edit ] Main articles: Pointwise convergence and Uniform convergence Let f : S × T → R.

{\displaystyle f:S\times T\to \mathbb {R}.

} Instead of taking limit as ( x , y ) → ( p , q ) , we may consider taking the limit of just one variable, say, x → p , to obtain a single-variable function of y , namely g : T → R.

{\displaystyle g:T\to \mathbb {R}.

} In fact, this limiting process can be done in two distinct ways.

The first one is called pointwise limit.

We say the pointwise limit of f as x approaches p is g , denoted lim x → p f ( x , y ) = g ( y ) , {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to p}f(x,y)=g(y),} or lim x → p f ( x , y ) = g ( y ) pointwise.

{\displaystyle \lim _{x\to p}f(x,y)=g(y)\;\;{\text{pointwise}}.

} Alternatively, we may say f tends to g pointwise as x approaches p , denoted f ( x , y ) → g ( y ) as x → p , {\displaystyle f(x,y)\to g(y)\;\;{\text{as}}\;\;x\to p,} or f ( x , y ) → g ( y ) pointwise as x → p.

{\displaystyle f(x,y)\to g(y)\;\;{\text{pointwise}}\;\;{\text{as}}\;\;x\to p.

} This limit exists if the following holds: For every ε > 0 and every fixed y in T , there exists a δ ( ε , y ) > 0 such that for all x in S , whenever 0 < | x − p | < δ , we have | f ( x , y ) − g ( y ) | < ε.

[16] ( ∀ ε > 0 ) ( ∀ y ∈ T ) ( ∃ δ > 0 ) ( ∀ x ∈ S ) ( 0 < | x − p | < δ ⟹ | f ( x , y ) − g ( y ) | < ε ).

{\displaystyle (\forall \varepsilon >0)\,(\forall y\in T)\,(\exists \delta >0)\,(\forall x\in S)\,(0<|x-p|<\delta \implies |f(x,y)-g(y)|<\varepsilon ).

} Here, δ = δ ( ε , y ) is a function of both ε and y.

Each δ is chosen for a specific point of y.

Hence we say the limit is pointwise in y.

For example, f ( x , y ) = x cos ⁡ y {\displaystyle f(x,y)={\frac {x}{\cos y}}} has a pointwise limit of constant zero function lim x → 0 f ( x , y ) = 0 ( y ) pointwise {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0}f(x,y)=0(y)\;\;{\text{pointwise}}} because for every fixed y , the limit is clearly 0.

This argument fails if y is not fixed: if y is very close to π /2 , the value of the fraction may deviate from 0.

This leads to another definition of limit, namely the uniform limit.

We say the uniform limit of f on T as x approaches p is g , denoted u n i f lim x → p y ∈ T f ( x , y ) = g ( y ) , {\displaystyle {\underset {{x\to p} \atop {y\in T}}{\mathrm {unif} \lim \;}}f(x,y)=g(y),} or lim x → p f ( x , y ) = g ( y ) uniformly on T.

{\displaystyle \lim _{x\to p}f(x,y)=g(y)\;\;{\text{uniformly on}}\;T.

} Alternatively, we may say f tends to g uniformly on T as x approaches p , denoted f ( x , y ) ⇉ g ( y ) on T as x → p , {\displaystyle f(x,y)\rightrightarrows g(y)\;{\text{on}}\;T\;\;{\text{as}}\;\;x\to p,} or f ( x , y ) → g ( y ) uniformly on T as x → p.

{\displaystyle f(x,y)\to g(y)\;\;{\text{uniformly on}}\;T\;\;{\text{as}}\;\;x\to p.

} This limit exists if the following holds: For every ε > 0 , there exists a δ ( ε ) > 0 such that for all x in S and y in T , whenever 0 < | x − p | < δ , we have | f ( x , y ) − g ( y ) | < ε.

[16] ( ∀ ε > 0 ) ( ∃ δ > 0 ) ( ∀ x ∈ S ) ( ∀ y ∈ T ) ( 0 < | x − p | < δ ⟹ | f ( x , y ) − g ( y ) | < ε ).

{\displaystyle (\forall \varepsilon >0)\,(\exists \delta >0)\,(\forall x\in S)\,(\forall y\in T)\,(0<|x-p|<\delta \implies |f(x,y)-g(y)|<\varepsilon ).

} Here, δ = δ ( ε ) is a function of only ε but not y.

In other words, δ is uniformly applicable to all y in T.

Hence we say the limit is uniform in y.

For example, f ( x , y ) = x cos ⁡ y {\displaystyle f(x,y)=x\cos y} has a uniform limit of constant zero function lim x → 0 f ( x , y ) = 0 ( y ) uniformly on R {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0}f(x,y)=0(y)\;\;{\text{ uniformly on}}\;\mathbb {R} } because for all real y , cos y is bounded between [−1, 1].

Hence no matter how y behaves, we may use the sandwich theorem to show that the limit is 0.

Iterated limits [ edit ] Main article: Iterated limits Let f : S × T → R.

{\displaystyle f:S\times T\to \mathbb {R}.

} We may consider taking the limit of just one variable, say, x → p , to obtain a single-variable function of y , namely g : T → R , {\displaystyle g:T\to \mathbb {R} ,} and then take limit in the other variable, namely y → q , to get a number L.

Symbolically, lim y → q lim x → p f ( x , y ) = lim y → q g ( y ) = L.

{\displaystyle \lim _{y\to q}\lim _{x\to p}f(x,y)=\lim _{y\to q}g(y)=L.

} This limit is known as iterated limit of the multivariable function.

[17] The order of taking limits may affect the result, i.

e.

, lim y → q lim x → p f ( x , y ) ≠ lim x → p lim y → q f ( x , y ) {\displaystyle \lim _{y\to q}\lim _{x\to p}f(x,y)\neq \lim _{x\to p}\lim _{y\to q}f(x,y)} in general.

A sufficient condition of equality is given by the Moore-Osgood theorem , which requires the limit lim x → p f ( x , y ) = g ( y ) {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to p}f(x,y)=g(y)} to be uniform on T.

[18] Functions on metric spaces [ edit ] Suppose M and N are subsets of metric spaces A and B , respectively, and f : M → N is defined between M and N , with x ∈ M , p a limit point of M and L ∈ N.

It is said that the limit of f as x approaches p is L and write lim x → p f ( x ) = L {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to p}f(x)=L} if the following property holds: For every ε > 0 , there exists a δ > 0 such that for all points x ∈ M , 0 < d A ( x , p ) < δ implies d B ( f ( x ), L ) < ε.

[19] ( ∀ ε > 0 ) ( ∃ δ > 0 ) ( ∀ x ∈ M ) ( 0 < d A ( x , p ) < δ ⟹ d B ( f ( x ) , L ) < ε ).

{\displaystyle (\forall \varepsilon >0)\,(\exists \delta >0)\,(\forall x\in M)\,(0<d_{A}(x,p)<\delta \implies d_{B}(f(x),L)<\varepsilon ).

} Again, note that p need not be in the domain of f , nor does L need to be in the range of f , and even if f ( p ) is defined it need not be equal to L.

Euclidean metric [ edit ] The limit in Euclidean space is a direct generalization of limits to vector-valued functions.

For example, we may consider a function f : S × T → R 3 {\displaystyle f:S\times T\to \mathbb {R} ^{3}} such that f ( x , y ) = ( f 1 ( x , y ) , f 2 ( x , y ) , f 3 ( x , y ) ).

{\displaystyle f(x,y)=(f_{1}(x,y),f_{2}(x,y),f_{3}(x,y)).

} Then, under the usual Euclidean metric , lim ( x , y ) → ( p , q ) f ( x , y ) = ( L 1 , L 2 , L 3 ) {\displaystyle \lim _{(x,y)\to (p,q)}f(x,y)=(L_{1},L_{2},L_{3})} if the following holds: For every ε > 0 , there exists a δ > 0 such that for all x in S and y in T , 0 < ( x − p ) 2 + ( y − q ) 2 < δ {\textstyle 0<{\sqrt {(x-p)^{2}+(y-q)^{2}}}<\delta } implies ( f 1 − L 1 ) 2 + ( f 2 − L 2 ) 2 + ( f 3 − L 3 ) 2 < ε.

{\textstyle {\sqrt {(f_{1}-L_{1})^{2}+(f_{2}-L_{2})^{2}+(f_{3}-L_{3})^{2}}}<\varepsilon.

} [20] ( ∀ ε > 0 ) ( ∃ δ > 0 ) ( ∀ x ∈ S ) ( ∀ y ∈ T ) ( 0 < ( x − p ) 2 + ( y − q ) 2 < δ ⟹ ( f 1 − L 1 ) 2 + ( f 2 − L 2 ) 2 + ( f 3 − L 3 ) 2 < ε ).

{\displaystyle (\forall \varepsilon >0)\,(\exists \delta >0)\,(\forall x\in S)\,(\forall y\in T)\,\left(0<{\sqrt {(x-p)^{2}+(y-q)^{2}}}<\delta \implies {\sqrt {(f_{1}-L_{1})^{2}+(f_{2}-L_{2})^{2}+(f_{3}-L_{3})^{2}}}<\varepsilon \right).

} In this example, the function concerned are finite- dimension vector-valued function.

In this case, the limit theorem for vector-valued function states that if the limit of each component exists, then the limit of a vector-valued function equals the vector with each component taken the limit: [20] lim ( x , y ) → ( p , q ) ( f 1 ( x , y ) , f 2 ( x , y ) , f 3 ( x , y ) ) = ( lim ( x , y ) → ( p , q ) f 1 ( x , y ) , lim ( x , y ) → ( p , q ) f 2 ( x , y ) , lim ( x , y ) → ( p , q ) f 3 ( x , y ) ).

{\displaystyle \lim _{(x,y)\to (p,q)}{\Bigl (}f_{1}(x,y),f_{2}(x,y),f_{3}(x,y){\Bigr )}=\left(\lim _{(x,y)\to (p,q)}f_{1}(x,y),\lim _{(x,y)\to (p,q)}f_{2}(x,y),\lim _{(x,y)\to (p,q)}f_{3}(x,y)\right).

} Manhattan metric [ edit ] One might also want to consider spaces other than Euclidean space.

An example would be the Manhattan space.

Consider f : S → R 2 {\displaystyle f:S\to \mathbb {R} ^{2}} such that f ( x ) = ( f 1 ( x ) , f 2 ( x ) ).

{\displaystyle f(x)=(f_{1}(x),f_{2}(x)).

} Then, under the Manhattan metric , lim x → p f ( x ) = ( L 1 , L 2 ) {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to p}f(x)=(L_{1},L_{2})} if the following holds: For every ε > 0 , there exists a δ > 0 such that for all x in S , 0 < | x − p | < δ implies | f 1 − L 1 | + | f 2 − L 2 | < ε.

( ∀ ε > 0 ) ( ∃ δ > 0 ) ( ∀ x ∈ S ) ( 0 < | x − p | < δ ⟹ | f 1 − L 1 | + | f 2 − L 2 | < ε ).

{\displaystyle (\forall \varepsilon >0)\,(\exists \delta >0)\,(\forall x\in S)\,(0<|x-p|<\delta \implies |f_{1}-L_{1}|+|f_{2}-L_{2}|<\varepsilon ).

} Since this is also a finite-dimension vector-valued function, the limit theorem stated above also applies.

[21] Uniform metric [ edit ] Finally, we will discuss the limit in function space , which has infinite dimensions.

Consider a function f ( x , y ) in the function space S × T → R.

{\displaystyle S\times T\to \mathbb {R}.

} We want to find out as x approaches p , how f ( x , y ) will tend to another function g ( y ) , which is in the function space T → R.

{\displaystyle T\to \mathbb {R}.

} The "closeness" in this function space may be measured under the uniform metric.

[22] Then, we will say the uniform limit of f on T as x approaches p is g and write u n i f lim x → p y ∈ T f ( x , y ) = g ( y ) , {\displaystyle {\underset {{x\to p} \atop {y\in T}}{\mathrm {unif} \lim \;}}f(x,y)=g(y),} or lim x → p f ( x , y ) = g ( y ) uniformly on T , {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to p}f(x,y)=g(y)\;\;{\text{uniformly on}}\;T,} if the following holds: For every ε > 0 , there exists a δ > 0 such that for all x in S , 0 < | x − p | < δ implies sup y ∈ T | f ( x , y ) − g ( y ) | < ε.

{\displaystyle \sup _{y\in T}|f(x,y)-g(y)|<\varepsilon.

} ( ∀ ε > 0 ) ( ∃ δ > 0 ) ( ∀ x ∈ S ) ( 0 < | x − p | < δ ⟹ sup y ∈ T | f ( x , y ) − g ( y ) | < ε ).

{\displaystyle (\forall \varepsilon >0)\,(\exists \delta >0)\,(\forall x\in S)\,(0<|x-p|<\delta \implies \sup _{y\in T}|f(x,y)-g(y)|<\varepsilon ).

} In fact, one can see that this definition is equivalent to that of the uniform limit of a multivariable function introduced in the previous section.

Functions on topological spaces [ edit ] See also: Filters in topology § Limits of functions Suppose X and Y are topological spaces with Y a Hausdorff space.

Let p be a limit point of Ω ⊆ X , and L ∈ Y.

For a function f : Ω → Y , it is said that the limit of f as x approaches p is L , written lim x → p f ( x ) = L , {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to p}f(x)=L,} if the following property holds: For every open neighborhood V of L , there exists an open neighborhood U of p such that f ( U ∩ Ω − { p }) ⊆ V.

This last part of the definition can also be phrased "there exists an open punctured neighbourhood U of p such that f ( U ∩ Ω) ⊆ V ".

The domain of f does not need to contain p.

If it does, then the value of f at p is irrelevant to the definition of the limit.

In particular, if the domain of f is X − { p } (or all of X ), then the limit of f as x → p exists and is equal to L if, for all subsets Ω of X with limit point p , the limit of the restriction of f to Ω exists and is equal to L.

Sometimes this criterion is used to establish the non-existence of the two-sided limit of a function on ⁠ R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } ⁠ by showing that the one-sided limits either fail to exist or do not agree.

Such a view is fundamental in the field of general topology , where limits and continuity at a point are defined in terms of special families of subsets, called filters , or generalized sequences known as nets.

Alternatively, the requirement that Y be a Hausdorff space can be relaxed to the assumption that Y be a general topological space, but then the limit of a function may not be unique.

In particular, one can no longer talk about the limit of a function at a point, but rather a limit or the set of limits at a point.

A function is continuous at a limit point p of and in its domain if and only if f ( p ) is the (or, in the general case, a ) limit of f ( x ) as x tends to p.

There is another type of limit of a function, namely the sequential limit.

Let f : X → Y be a mapping from a topological space X into a Hausdorff space Y , p ∈ X a limit point of X and L ∈ Y.

The sequential limit of f as x tends to p is L if For every sequence ( x n ) in X − { p } that converges to p , the sequence f ( x n ) converges to L.

If L is the limit (in the sense above) of f as x approaches p , then it is a sequential limit as well, however the converse need not hold in general.

If in addition X is metrizable , then L is the sequential limit of f as x approaches p if and only if it is the limit (in the sense above) of f as x approaches p.

Other characterizations [ edit ] In terms of sequences [ edit ] For functions on the real line, one way to define the limit of a function is in terms of the limit of sequences.

(This definition is usually attributed to Eduard Heine.

) In this setting: lim x → a f ( x ) = L {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to a}f(x)=L} if, and only if, for all sequences x n (with x n not equal to a for all n ) converging to a the sequence f ( x n ) converges to L.

It was shown by Sierpiński in 1916 that proving the equivalence of this definition and the definition above, requires and is equivalent to a weak form of the axiom of choice.

Note that defining what it means for a sequence x n to converge to a requires the epsilon, delta method.

Similarly as it was the case of Weierstrass's definition, a more general Heine definition applies to functions defined on subsets of the real line.

Let f be a real-valued function with the domain Dm ( f ).

Let a be the limit of a sequence of elements of Dm ( f ) \ { a }.

Then the limit (in this sense) of f is L as x approaches p if for every sequence x n ∈ Dm ( f ) \ { a } (so that for all n , x n is not equal to a ) that converges to a , the sequence f ( x n ) converges to L.

This is the same as the definition of a sequential limit in the preceding section obtained by regarding the subset Dm ( f ) of ⁠ R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } ⁠ as a metric space with the induced metric.

In non-standard calculus [ edit ] In non-standard calculus the limit of a function is defined by: lim x → a f ( x ) = L {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to a}f(x)=L} if and only if for all x ∈ R ∗ , {\displaystyle x\in \mathbb {R} ^{*},} f ∗ ( x ) − L {\displaystyle f^{*}(x)-L} is infinitesimal whenever x − a is infinitesimal.

Here R ∗ {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{*}} are the hyperreal numbers and f* is the natural extension of f to the non-standard real numbers.

Keisler proved that such a hyperreal definition of limit reduces the quantifier complexity by two quantifiers.

[23] On the other hand, Hrbacek writes that for the definitions to be valid for all hyperreal numbers they must implicitly be grounded in the ε-δ method, and claims that, from the pedagogical point of view, the hope that non-standard calculus could be done without ε-δ methods cannot be realized in full.

[24] Bŀaszczyk et al.

detail the usefulness of microcontinuity in developing a transparent definition of uniform continuity, and characterize Hrbacek's criticism as a "dubious lament".

[25] In terms of nearness [ edit ] At the 1908 international congress of mathematics F.

Riesz introduced an alternate way defining limits and continuity in concept called "nearness".

[26] A point x is defined to be near a set A ⊆ R {\displaystyle A\subseteq \mathbb {R} } if for every r > 0 there is a point a ∈ A so that | x − a | < r.

In this setting the lim x → a f ( x ) = L {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to a}f(x)=L} if and only if for all A ⊆ R , {\displaystyle A\subseteq \mathbb {R} ,} L is near f ( A ) whenever a is near A.

Here f ( A ) is the set { f ( x ) | x ∈ A }.

{\displaystyle \{f(x)|x\in A\}.

} This definition can also be extended to metric and topological spaces.

Relationship to continuity [ edit ] Main article: Continuous function The notion of the limit of a function is very closely related to the concept of continuity.

A function f is said to be continuous at c if it is both defined at c and its value at c equals the limit of f as x approaches c : lim x → c f ( x ) = f ( c ).

{\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}f(x)=f(c).

} We have here assumed that c is a limit point of the domain of f.

Properties [ edit ] If a function f is real-valued, then the limit of f at p is L if and only if both the right-handed limit and left-handed limit of f at p exist and are equal to L.

[27] The function f is continuous at p if and only if the limit of f ( x ) as x approaches p exists and is equal to f ( p ).

If f : M → N is a function between metric spaces M and N , then it is equivalent that f transforms every sequence in M which converges towards p into a sequence in N which converges towards f ( p ).

If N is a normed vector space , then the limit operation is linear in the following sense: if the limit of f ( x ) as x approaches p is L and the limit of g ( x ) as x approaches p is P , then the limit of f ( x ) + g( x ) as x approaches p is L + P.

If a is a scalar from the base field , then the limit of af ( x ) as x approaches p is aL.

If f and g are real-valued (or complex-valued) functions, then taking the limit of an operation on f ( x ) and g ( x ) (e.

g.

, f + g , f − g , f × g , f / g , f g ) under certain conditions is compatible with the operation of limits of f ( x ) and g ( x ).

This fact is often called the algebraic limit theorem.

The main condition needed to apply the following rules is that the limits on the right-hand sides of the equations exist (in other words, these limits are finite values including 0).

Additionally, the identity for division requires that the denominator on the right-hand side is non-zero (division by 0 is not defined), and the identity for exponentiation requires that the base is positive, or zero while the exponent is positive (finite).

lim x → p ( f ( x ) + g ( x ) ) = lim x → p f ( x ) + lim x → p g ( x ) lim x → p ( f ( x ) − g ( x ) ) = lim x → p f ( x ) − lim x → p g ( x ) lim x → p ( f ( x ) ⋅ g ( x ) ) = lim x → p f ( x ) ⋅ lim x → p g ( x ) lim x → p ( f ( x ) / g ( x ) ) = lim x → p f ( x ) / lim x → p g ( x ) lim x → p f ( x ) g ( x ) = lim x → p f ( x ) lim x → p g ( x ) {\displaystyle {\begin{array}{lcl}\displaystyle \lim _{x\to p}(f(x)+g(x))&=&\displaystyle \lim _{x\to p}f(x)+\lim _{x\to p}g(x)\\\displaystyle \lim _{x\to p}(f(x)-g(x))&=&\displaystyle \lim _{x\to p}f(x)-\lim _{x\to p}g(x)\\\displaystyle \lim _{x\to p}(f(x)\cdot g(x))&=&\displaystyle \lim _{x\to p}f(x)\cdot \lim _{x\to p}g(x)\\\displaystyle \lim _{x\to p}(f(x)/g(x))&=&\displaystyle {\lim _{x\to p}f(x)/\lim _{x\to p}g(x)}\\\displaystyle \lim _{x\to p}f(x)^{g(x)}&=&\displaystyle {\lim _{x\to p}f(x)^{\lim _{x\to p}g(x)}}\end{array}}} These rules are also valid for one-sided limits, including when p is ∞ or −∞.

In each rule above, when one of the limits on the right is ∞ or −∞, the limit on the left may sometimes still be determined by the following rules.

q + ∞ = ∞ if q ≠ − ∞ q × ∞ = { ∞ if q > 0 − ∞ if q < 0 q ∞ = 0 if q ≠ ∞ and q ≠ − ∞ ∞ q = { 0 if q < 0 ∞ if q > 0 q ∞ = { 0 if 0 < q < 1 ∞ if q > 1 q − ∞ = { ∞ if 0 < q < 1 0 if q > 1 {\displaystyle {\begin{array}{rcl}q+\infty &=&\infty {\text{ if }}q\neq -\infty \\[8pt]q\times \infty &=&{\begin{cases}\infty &{\text{if }}q>0\\-\infty &{\text{if }}q<0\end{cases}}\\[6pt]\displaystyle {\frac {q}{\infty }}&=&0{\text{ if }}q\neq \infty {\text{ and }}q\neq -\infty \\[6pt]\infty ^{q}&=&{\begin{cases}0&{\text{if }}q<0\\\infty &{\text{if }}q>0\end{cases}}\\[4pt]q^{\infty }&=&{\begin{cases}0&{\text{if }}0<q<1\\\infty &{\text{if }}q>1\end{cases}}\\[4pt]q^{-\infty }&=&{\begin{cases}\infty &{\text{if }}0<q<1\\0&{\text{if }}q>1\end{cases}}\end{array}}} (see also Extended real number line ).

In other cases the limit on the left may still exist, although the right-hand side, called an indeterminate form , does not allow one to determine the result.

This depends on the functions f and g.

These indeterminate forms are: 0 0 ± ∞ ± ∞ 0 × ± ∞ ∞ + − ∞ 0 0 ∞ 0 1 ± ∞ {\displaystyle {\begin{array}{cc}\displaystyle {\frac {0}{0}}&\displaystyle {\frac {\pm \infty }{\pm \infty }}\\[6pt]0\times \pm \infty &\infty +-\infty \\[8pt]\qquad 0^{0}\qquad &\qquad \infty ^{0}\qquad \\[8pt]1^{\pm \infty }\end{array}}} See further L'Hôpital's rule below and Indeterminate form.

Limits of compositions of functions [ edit ] In general, from knowing that lim y → b f ( y ) = c {\displaystyle \lim _{y\to b}f(y)=c} and lim x → a g ( x ) = b , {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to a}g(x)=b,} it does not follow that lim x → a f ( g ( x ) ) = c.

{\displaystyle \lim _{x\to a}f(g(x))=c.

} However, this "chain rule" does hold if one of the following additional conditions holds: f ( b ) = c (that is, f is continuous at b ), or g does not take the value b near a (that is, there exists a δ > 0 such that if 0 < | x − a | < δ then | g ( x ) − b | > 0 ).

As an example of this phenomenon, consider the following function that violates both additional restrictions: f ( x ) = g ( x ) = { 0 if x ≠ 0 1 if x = 0 {\displaystyle f(x)=g(x)={\begin{cases}0&{\text{if }}x\neq 0\\1&{\text{if }}x=0\end{cases}}} Since the value at f (0) is a removable discontinuity , lim x → a f ( x ) = 0 {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to a}f(x)=0} for all a.

Thus, the naïve chain rule would suggest that the limit of f ( f ( x )) is 0.

However, it is the case that f ( f ( x ) ) = { 1 if x ≠ 0 0 if x = 0 {\displaystyle f(f(x))={\begin{cases}1&{\text{if }}x\neq 0\\0&{\text{if }}x=0\end{cases}}} and so lim x → a f ( f ( x ) ) = 1 {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to a}f(f(x))=1} for all a.

Limits of special interest [ edit ] Main article: List of limits Rational functions [ edit ] For n a nonnegative integer and constants a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , … , a n {\displaystyle a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\ldots ,a_{n}} and b 1 , b 2 , b 3 , … , b n , {\displaystyle b_{1},b_{2},b_{3},\ldots ,b_{n},} lim x → ∞ a 1 x n + a 2 x n − 1 + a 3 x n − 2 + ⋯ + a n b 1 x n + b 2 x n − 1 + b 3 x n − 2 + ⋯ + b n = a 1 b 1 {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to \infty }{\frac {a_{1}x^{n}+a_{2}x^{n-1}+a_{3}x^{n-2}+\dots +a_{n}}{b_{1}x^{n}+b_{2}x^{n-1}+b_{3}x^{n-2}+\dots +b_{n}}}={\frac {a_{1}}{b_{1}}}} This can be proven by dividing both the numerator and denominator by x n.

If the numerator is a polynomial of higher degree, the limit does not exist.

If the denominator is of higher degree, the limit is 0.

Trigonometric functions [ edit ] lim x → 0 sin ⁡ x x = 1 lim x → 0 1 − cos ⁡ x x = 0 {\displaystyle {\begin{array}{lcl}\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0}{\frac {\sin x}{x}}&=&1\\[4pt]\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0}{\frac {1-\cos x}{x}}&=&0\end{array}}} Exponential functions [ edit ] lim x → 0 ( 1 + x ) 1 x = lim r → ∞ ( 1 + 1 r ) r = e lim x → 0 e x − 1 x = 1 lim x → 0 e a x − 1 b x = a b lim x → 0 c a x − 1 b x = a b ln ⁡ c lim x → 0 + x x = 1 {\displaystyle {\begin{array}{lcl}\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0}(1+x)^{\frac {1}{x}}&=&\displaystyle \lim _{r\to \infty }\left(1+{\frac {1}{r}}\right)^{r}=e\\[4pt]\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0}{\frac {e^{x}-1}{x}}&=&1\\[4pt]\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0}{\frac {e^{ax}-1}{bx}}&=&\displaystyle {\frac {a}{b}}\\[4pt]\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0}{\frac {c^{ax}-1}{bx}}&=&\displaystyle {\frac {a}{b}}\ln c\\[4pt]\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0^{+}}x^{x}&=&1\end{array}}} Logarithmic functions [ edit ] lim x → 0 ln ⁡ ( 1 + x ) x = 1 lim x → 0 ln ⁡ ( 1 + a x ) b x = a b lim x → 0 log c ⁡ ( 1 + a x ) b x = a b ln ⁡ c {\displaystyle {\begin{array}{lcl}\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0}{\frac {\ln(1+x)}{x}}&=&1\\[4pt]\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0}{\frac {\ln(1+ax)}{bx}}&=&\displaystyle {\frac {a}{b}}\\[4pt]\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0}{\frac {\log _{c}(1+ax)}{bx}}&=&\displaystyle {\frac {a}{b\ln c}}\end{array}}} L'Hôpital's rule [ edit ] Main article: l'Hôpital's rule This rule uses derivatives to find limits of indeterminate forms 0/0 or ±∞/∞ , and only applies to such cases.

Other indeterminate forms may be manipulated into this form.

Given two functions f ( x ) and g ( x ) , defined over an open interval I containing the desired limit point c , then if: lim x → c f ( x ) = lim x → c g ( x ) = 0 , {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}f(x)=\lim _{x\to c}g(x)=0,} or lim x → c f ( x ) = ± lim x → c g ( x ) = ± ∞ , {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}f(x)=\pm \lim _{x\to c}g(x)=\pm \infty ,} and f {\displaystyle f} and g {\displaystyle g} are differentiable over I ∖ { c } , {\displaystyle I\setminus \{c\},} and g ′ ( x ) ≠ 0 {\displaystyle g'(x)\neq 0} for all x ∈ I ∖ { c } , {\displaystyle x\in I\setminus \{c\},} and lim x → c f ′ ( x ) g ′ ( x ) {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}{\tfrac {f'(x)}{g'(x)}}} exists, then: lim x → c f ( x ) g ( x ) = lim x → c f ′ ( x ) g ′ ( x ).

{\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}{\frac {f(x)}{g(x)}}=\lim _{x\to c}{\frac {f'(x)}{g'(x)}}.

} Normally, the first condition is the most important one.

For example: lim x → 0 sin ⁡ ( 2 x ) sin ⁡ ( 3 x ) = lim x → 0 2 cos ⁡ ( 2 x ) 3 cos ⁡ ( 3 x ) = 2 ⋅ 1 3 ⋅ 1 = 2 3.

{\displaystyle \lim _{x\to 0}{\frac {\sin(2x)}{\sin(3x)}}=\lim _{x\to 0}{\frac {2\cos(2x)}{3\cos(3x)}}={\frac {2\cdot 1}{3\cdot 1}}={\frac {2}{3}}.

} Summations and integrals [ edit ] Specifying an infinite bound on a summation or integral is a common shorthand for specifying a limit.

A short way to write the limit lim n → ∞ ∑ i = s n f ( i ) {\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }\sum _{i=s}^{n}f(i)} is ∑ i = s ∞ f ( i ).

{\displaystyle \sum _{i=s}^{\infty }f(i).

} An important example of limits of sums such as these are series.

A short way to write the limit lim x → ∞ ∫ a x f ( t ) d t {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to \infty }\int _{a}^{x}f(t)\;dt} is ∫ a ∞ f ( t ) d t.

{\displaystyle \int _{a}^{\infty }f(t)\;dt.

} A short way to write the limit lim x → − ∞ ∫ x b f ( t ) d t {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to -\infty }\int _{x}^{b}f(t)\;dt} is ∫ − ∞ b f ( t ) d t.

{\displaystyle \int _{-\infty }^{b}f(t)\;dt.
