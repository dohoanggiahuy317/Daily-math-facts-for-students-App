Definition [ edit ] Let ( X , Σ , μ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma ,\mu )} be a measure space , and B {\displaystyle B} be a Banach space.

The Bochner integral of a function f : X → B {\displaystyle f:X\to B} is defined in much the same way as the Lebesgue integral.

First, define a simple function to be any finite sum of the form s n ( x ) = ∑ i = 1 n χ E i ( x ) b i , {\displaystyle s_{n}(x)=\sum _{i=1}^{n}\chi _{E_{i}}(x)b_{i},} where the E i {\displaystyle E_{i}} are disjoint members of the σ {\displaystyle \sigma } -algebra Σ , {\displaystyle \Sigma ,} the b i {\displaystyle b_{i}} are distinct elements of B , {\displaystyle B,} and χ E is the characteristic function of E.

{\displaystyle E.

} If μ ( E i ) {\displaystyle \mu \left(E_{i}\right)} is finite whenever b i ≠ 0 , {\displaystyle b_{i}\neq 0,} then the simple function is integrable , and the integral is then defined by ∫ X [ ∑ i = 1 n χ E i ( x ) b i ] d μ = ∑ i = 1 n μ ( E i ) b i {\displaystyle \int _{X}\left[\sum _{i=1}^{n}\chi _{E_{i}}(x)b_{i}\right]\,d\mu =\sum _{i=1}^{n}\mu (E_{i})b_{i}} exactly as it is for the ordinary Lebesgue integral.

A measurable function f : X → B {\displaystyle f:X\to B} is Bochner integrable if there exists a sequence of integrable simple functions s n {\displaystyle s_{n}} such that lim n → ∞ ∫ X ‖ f − s n ‖ B d μ = 0 , {\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }\int _{X}\|f-s_{n}\|_{B}\,d\mu =0,} where the integral on the left-hand side is an ordinary Lebesgue integral.

In this case, the Bochner integral is defined by ∫ X f d μ = lim n → ∞ ∫ X s n d μ.

{\displaystyle \int _{X}f\,d\mu =\lim _{n\to \infty }\int _{X}s_{n}\,d\mu.

} It can be shown that the sequence { ∫ X s n d μ } n = 1 ∞ {\displaystyle \left\{\int _{X}s_{n}\,d\mu \right\}_{n=1}^{\infty }} is a Cauchy sequence in the Banach space B , {\displaystyle B,} hence the limit on the right exists; furthermore, the limit is independent of the approximating sequence of simple functions { s n } n = 1 ∞.

{\displaystyle \{s_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty }.

} These remarks show that the integral is well-defined (i.

e independent of any choices).

It can be shown that a function is Bochner integrable if and only if it lies in the Bochner space L 1.

{\displaystyle L^{1}.

} Properties [ edit ] Elementary properties [ edit ] Many of the familiar properties of the Lebesgue integral continue to hold for the Bochner integral.

Particularly useful is Bochner's criterion for integrability, which states that if ( X , Σ , μ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma ,\mu )} is a measure space, then a Bochner-measurable function f : X → B {\displaystyle f\colon X\to B} is Bochner integrable if and only if ∫ X ‖ f ‖ B d μ < ∞.

{\displaystyle \int _{X}\|f\|_{B}\,\mathrm {d} \mu <\infty.

} Here, a function f : X → B {\displaystyle f\colon X\to B} is called Bochner measurable if it is equal μ {\displaystyle \mu } -almost everywhere to a function g {\displaystyle g} taking values in a separable subspace B 0 {\displaystyle B_{0}} of B {\displaystyle B} , and such that the inverse image g − 1 ( U ) {\displaystyle g^{-1}(U)} of every open set U {\displaystyle U} in B {\displaystyle B} belongs to Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma }.

Equivalently, f {\displaystyle f} is the limit μ {\displaystyle \mu } -almost everywhere of a sequence of countably-valued simple functions.

Linear operators [ edit ] If T : B → B ′ {\displaystyle T\colon B\to B'} is a continuous linear operator between Banach spaces B {\displaystyle B} and B ′ {\displaystyle B'} , and f : X → B {\displaystyle f\colon X\to B} is Bochner integrable, then it is relatively straightforward to show that T f : X → B ′ {\displaystyle Tf\colon X\to B'} is Bochner integrable and integration and the application of T {\displaystyle T} may be interchanged: ∫ E T f d μ = T ∫ E f d μ {\displaystyle \int _{E}Tf\,\mathrm {d} \mu =T\int _{E}f\,\mathrm {d} \mu } for all measurable subsets E ∈ Σ {\displaystyle E\in \Sigma }.

A non-trivially stronger form of this result, known as Hille's theorem , also holds for closed operators.

[1] If T : B → B ′ {\displaystyle T\colon B\to B'} is a closed linear operator between Banach spaces B {\displaystyle B} and B ′ {\displaystyle B'} and both f : X → B {\displaystyle f\colon X\to B} and T f : X → B ′ {\displaystyle Tf\colon X\to B'} are Bochner integrable, then ∫ E T f d μ = T ∫ E f d μ {\displaystyle \int _{E}Tf\,\mathrm {d} \mu =T\int _{E}f\,\mathrm {d} \mu } for all measurable subsets E ∈ Σ {\displaystyle E\in \Sigma }.

Dominated convergence theorem [ edit ] A version of the dominated convergence theorem also holds for the Bochner integral.

Specifically, if f n : X → B {\displaystyle f_{n}\colon X\to B} is a sequence of measurable functions on a complete measure space tending almost everywhere to a limit function f {\displaystyle f} , and if ‖ f n ( x ) ‖ B ≤ g ( x ) {\displaystyle \|f_{n}(x)\|_{B}\leq g(x)} for almost every x ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} , and g ∈ L 1 ( μ ) {\displaystyle g\in L^{1}(\mu )} , then ∫ E ‖ f − f n ‖ B d μ → 0 {\displaystyle \int _{E}\|f-f_{n}\|_{B}\,\mathrm {d} \mu \to 0} as n → ∞ {\displaystyle n\to \infty } and ∫ E f n d μ → ∫ E f d μ {\displaystyle \int _{E}f_{n}\,\mathrm {d} \mu \to \int _{E}f\,\mathrm {d} \mu } for all E ∈ Σ {\displaystyle E\in \Sigma }.

If f {\displaystyle f} is Bochner integrable, then the inequality ‖ ∫ E f d μ ‖ B ≤ ∫ E ‖ f ‖ B d μ {\displaystyle \left\|\int _{E}f\,\mathrm {d} \mu \right\|_{B}\leq \int _{E}\|f\|_{B}\,\mathrm {d} \mu } holds for all E ∈ Σ.

{\displaystyle E\in \Sigma.

} In particular, the set function E ↦ ∫ E f d μ {\displaystyle E\mapsto \int _{E}f\,\mathrm {d} \mu } defines a countably-additive B {\displaystyle B} -valued vector measure on X {\displaystyle X} which is absolutely continuous with respect to μ {\displaystyle \mu }.

Radon–Nikodym property [ edit ] An important fact about the Bochner integral is that the Radon–Nikodym theorem fails to hold in general, and instead is a property (the Radon–Nikodym property ) defining an important class of nice Banach spaces.

Specifically, if μ {\displaystyle \mu } is a measure on ( X , Σ ) , {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma ),} then B {\displaystyle B} has the Radon–Nikodym property with respect to μ {\displaystyle \mu } if, for every countably-additive vector measure γ {\displaystyle \gamma } on ( X , Σ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma )} with values in B {\displaystyle B} which has bounded variation and is absolutely continuous with respect to μ , {\displaystyle \mu ,} there is a μ {\displaystyle \mu } -integrable function g : X → B {\displaystyle g:X\to B} such that γ ( E ) = ∫ E g d μ {\displaystyle \gamma (E)=\int _{E}g\,d\mu } for every measurable set E ∈ Σ.

{\displaystyle E\in \Sigma.

} [2] The Banach space B {\displaystyle B} has the Radon–Nikodym property if B {\displaystyle B} has the Radon–Nikodym property with respect to every finite measure.

[2] Equivalent formulations include: Bounded discrete-time martingales in B {\displaystyle B} converge a.

s.

[3] Functions of bounded-variation into B {\displaystyle B} are differentiable a.

e.

[4] For every bounded D ⊆ B {\displaystyle D\subseteq B} , there exists f ∈ B ∗ {\displaystyle f\in B^{*}} and δ ∈ R + {\displaystyle \delta \in \mathbb {R} ^{+}} such that { x : f ( x ) + δ > sup f ( D ) } ⊆ D {\displaystyle \{x:f(x)+\delta >\sup {f(D)}\}\subseteq D} has arbitrarily small diameter.

[3] It is known that the space ℓ 1 {\displaystyle \ell _{1}} has the Radon–Nikodym property, but c 0 {\displaystyle c_{0}} and the spaces L ∞ ( Ω ) , {\displaystyle L^{\infty }(\Omega ),} L 1 ( Ω ) , {\displaystyle L^{1}(\Omega ),} for Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } an open bounded subset of R n , {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n},} and C ( K ) , {\displaystyle C(K),} for K {\displaystyle K} an infinite compact space, do not.

[5] Spaces with Radon–Nikodym property include separable dual spaces (this is the Dunford–Pettis theorem ) [ citation needed ] and reflexive spaces , which include, in particular, Hilbert spaces.

"Early workers in this field were concerned with the Banach space property that each X -valued function of bounded variation on [0,1] be differentiable almost surely.

It turns out that this property (known as the Gelfand-Fréchet property) is also equivalent to the RNP [Radon-Nikodym Property].
