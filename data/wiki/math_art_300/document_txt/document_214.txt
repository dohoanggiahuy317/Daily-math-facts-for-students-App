For use in arithmetic and algebra, see Exponentiation.

The power number N p (also known as Newton number ) is a commonly used dimensionless number relating the resistance force to the inertia force.

The power-number has different specifications according to the field of application.

, for stirrers the power number is defined as: [1] N p = P ρ n 3 D 5 {\displaystyle N_{\mathrm {p} }={\frac {P}{\rho n^{3}D^{5}}}} with P : power ρ : fluid density n : rotational speed in revolutions per second D : diameter of stirrer References [ edit ] ^ Seinfeld, John H (1991).
