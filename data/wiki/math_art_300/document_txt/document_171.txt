Calculus (from Latin calculus meaning ‘pebble’, plural calculī ) in its most general sense is any method or system of calculation.

Calculus may refer to: Biology [ edit ] Calculus (spider) , a genus of the family Oonopidae Caseolus calculus , a genus and species of small land snails Mathematics [ edit ] Infinitesimal calculus (or simply calculus ), which investigates motion and rates of change Differential calculus Integral calculus Non-standard calculus , an approach to infinitesimal calculus using Robinson's infinitesimals Calculus of sums and differences ( difference operator ), also called the finite-difference calculus, a discrete analogue of "calculus" Functional calculus , a way to apply various types of functions to operators Schubert calculus , a branch of algebraic geometry Tensor calculus (also called tensor analysis), a generalization of vector calculus that encompasses tensor fields Vector calculus (also called vector analysis), comprising specialized notations for multivariable analysis of vectors in an inner-product space Matrix calculus , a specialized notation for multivariable calculus over spaces of matrices Numerical calculus (also called numerical analysis), the study of numerical approximations Umbral calculus , the combinatorics of certain operations on polynomials The calculus of variations , a field of study that deals with extremizing functionals Itô calculus An extension of calculus to stochastic processes.
