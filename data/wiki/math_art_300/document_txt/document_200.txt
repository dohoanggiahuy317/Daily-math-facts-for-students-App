( edit | history ) How to add to the community bulletin board The community bulletin board has 2 sections that can be used by Wikipedians for announcements: "Events and projects" and "WikiProject notices".

In general, keep it concise (under 2 lines), refrain from fancy formatting , and new entries should be placed at the top of their section.

Events and projects : In this section, only organized events, projects, and/or competitions should be listed.

These are organized by how often they occur: The Yearly section is for uncommon events, like events that only occur every year, once, or irregularly.

The Monthly section is for events that occur each month, or are always ongoing.

WikiProject notices : In this section, any announcement, request for help or other notice from a WikiProject should be listed here.

Entries should be signed, and ordered from newest to oldest.

Entries are to be removed after a period of 6 months.

Recent changes At the Wikimedia Foundation a new task force was formed to replace the disabled Graph with more secure, easy to use, and extensible Chart.

You can subscribe to the newsletter to get notified about new project updates and other news about Chart.

The CampaignEvents extension is now available on Meta-wiki, Igbo Wikipedia, and Swahili Wikipedia, and can be requested on your wiki.

This extension helps in managing and making events more visible, giving Event organizers the ability to use tools like the Event registration tool.

To learn more about the deployment status and how to request this extension for your wiki, visit the CampaignEvents page on Meta-wiki.

Editors using the iOS Wikipedia app who have more than 50 edits can now use the Add an Image feature.

This feature presents opportunities for small but useful contributions to Wikipedia.

Thank you to all of the authors who have contributed to MediaWiki Core.

As a result of these contributions, the percentage of authors contributing more than 5 patches has increased by 25% since last year , which helps ensure the sustainability of the platform for the Wikimedia projects.

Problems A problem with the color of the talkpage tabs always showing as blue, even for non-existent pages which should have been red, affecting the Vector 2022 skin, has been fixed.

Future changes The Trust and Safety Product team wants to introduce temporary accounts with as little disruption to tools and workflows as possible.

Volunteer developers, including gadget and user-script maintainers, are kindly asked to update the code of their tools and features to handle temporary accounts.

The team has created documentation explaining how to do the update.
