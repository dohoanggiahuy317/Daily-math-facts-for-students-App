More precisely, if the inverse of f {\displaystyle f} is denoted as f − 1 {\displaystyle f^{-1}} , where f − 1 ( y ) = x {\displaystyle f^{-1}(y)=x} if and only if f ( x ) = y {\displaystyle f(x)=y} , then the inverse function rule is, in Lagrange's notation , [ f − 1 ] ′ ( a ) = 1 f ′ ( f − 1 ( a ) ) {\displaystyle \left[f^{-1}\right]'(a)={\frac {1}{f'\left(f^{-1}(a)\right)}}}.

This formula holds in general whenever f {\displaystyle f} is continuous and injective on an interval I , with f {\displaystyle f} being differentiable at f − 1 ( a ) {\displaystyle f^{-1}(a)} ( ∈ I {\displaystyle \in I} ) and where f ′ ( f − 1 ( a ) ) ≠ 0 {\displaystyle f'(f^{-1}(a))\neq 0}.

The same formula is also equivalent to the expression D [ f − 1 ] = 1 ( D f ) ∘ ( f − 1 ) , {\displaystyle {\mathcal {D}}\left[f^{-1}\right]={\frac {1}{({\mathcal {D}}f)\circ \left(f^{-1}\right)}},} where D {\displaystyle {\mathcal {D}}} denotes the unary derivative operator (on the space of functions) and ∘ {\displaystyle \circ } denotes function composition.

Geometrically, a function and inverse function have graphs that are reflections , in the line y = x {\displaystyle y=x}.

This reflection operation turns the gradient of any line into its reciprocal.

[1] Assuming that f {\displaystyle f} has an inverse in a neighbourhood of x {\displaystyle x} and that its derivative at that point is non-zero, its inverse is guaranteed to be differentiable at x {\displaystyle x} and have a derivative given by the above formula.

The inverse function rule may also be expressed in Leibniz's notation.

As that notation suggests, d x d y ⋅ d y d x = 1.

{\displaystyle {\frac {dx}{dy}}\,\cdot \,{\frac {dy}{dx}}=1.

} This relation is obtained by differentiating the equation f − 1 ( y ) = x {\displaystyle f^{-1}(y)=x} in terms of x and applying the chain rule , yielding that: d x d y ⋅ d y d x = d x d x {\displaystyle {\frac {dx}{dy}}\,\cdot \,{\frac {dy}{dx}}={\frac {dx}{dx}}} considering that the derivative of x with respect to x is 1.

Derivation [ edit ] Let f {\displaystyle f} be an invertible (bijective) function, let x {\displaystyle x} be in the domain of f {\displaystyle f} , and let y {\displaystyle y} be in the codomain of f {\displaystyle f}.

Since f is a bijective function, y {\displaystyle y} is in the range of f {\displaystyle f}.

This also means that y {\displaystyle y} is in the domain of f − 1 {\displaystyle f^{-1}} , and that x {\displaystyle x} is in the codomain of f − 1 {\displaystyle f^{-1}}.

Since f {\displaystyle f} is an invertible function, we know that f ( f − 1 ( y ) ) = y {\displaystyle f(f^{-1}(y))=y}.

The inverse function rule can be obtained by taking the derivative of this equation.

d d y f ( f − 1 ( y ) ) = d d y y {\displaystyle {\dfrac {\mathrm {d} }{\mathrm {d} y}}f(f^{-1}(y))={\dfrac {\mathrm {d} }{\mathrm {d} y}}y} The right side is equal to 1 and the chain rule can be applied to the left side: d ( f ( f − 1 ( y ) ) ) d ( f − 1 ( y ) ) d ( f − 1 ( y ) ) d y = 1 d f ( f − 1 ( y ) ) d f − 1 ( y ) d f − 1 ( y ) d y = 1 f ′ ( f − 1 ( y ) ) ( f − 1 ) ′ ( y ) = 1 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\dfrac {\mathrm {d} \left(f(f^{-1}(y))\right)}{\mathrm {d} \left(f^{-1}(y)\right)}}{\dfrac {\mathrm {d} \left(f^{-1}(y)\right)}{\mathrm {d} y}}&=1\\{\dfrac {\mathrm {d} f(f^{-1}(y))}{\mathrm {d} f^{-1}(y)}}{\dfrac {\mathrm {d} f^{-1}(y)}{\mathrm {d} y}}&=1\\f^{\prime }(f^{-1}(y))(f^{-1})^{\prime }(y)&=1\end{aligned}}} Rearranging then gives ( f − 1 ) ′ ( y ) = 1 f ′ ( f − 1 ( y ) ) {\displaystyle (f^{-1})^{\prime }(y)={\frac {1}{f^{\prime }(f^{-1}(y))}}} Rather than using y {\displaystyle y} as the variable, we can rewrite this equation using a {\displaystyle a} as the input for f − 1 {\displaystyle f^{-1}} , and we get the following: [2] ( f − 1 ) ′ ( a ) = 1 f ′ ( f − 1 ( a ) ) {\displaystyle (f^{-1})^{\prime }(a)={\frac {1}{f^{\prime }\left(f^{-1}(a)\right)}}} Examples [ edit ] y = x 2 {\displaystyle y=x^{2}} (for positive x ) has inverse x = y {\displaystyle x={\sqrt {y}}}.

d y d x = 2 x ; d x d y = 1 2 y = 1 2 x {\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}=2x{\mbox{ }}{\mbox{ }}{\mbox{ }}{\mbox{ }};{\mbox{ }}{\mbox{ }}{\mbox{ }}{\mbox{ }}{\frac {dx}{dy}}={\frac {1}{2{\sqrt {y}}}}={\frac {1}{2x}}} d y d x ⋅ d x d y = 2 x ⋅ 1 2 x = 1.

{\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}\,\cdot \,{\frac {dx}{dy}}=2x\cdot {\frac {1}{2x}}=1.

} At x = 0 {\displaystyle x=0} , however, there is a problem: the graph of the square root function becomes vertical, corresponding to a horizontal tangent for the square function.

y = e x {\displaystyle y=e^{x}} (for real x ) has inverse x = ln ⁡ y {\displaystyle x=\ln {y}} (for positive y {\displaystyle y} ) d y d x = e x ; d x d y = 1 y = e − x {\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}=e^{x}{\mbox{ }}{\mbox{ }}{\mbox{ }}{\mbox{ }};{\mbox{ }}{\mbox{ }}{\mbox{ }}{\mbox{ }}{\frac {dx}{dy}}={\frac {1}{y}}=e^{-x}} d y d x ⋅ d x d y = e x ⋅ e − x = 1.

{\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}\,\cdot \,{\frac {dx}{dy}}=e^{x}\cdot e^{-x}=1.

} Additional properties [ edit ] Integrating this relationship gives f − 1 ( x ) = ∫ 1 f ′ ( f − 1 ( x ) ) d x + C.

{\displaystyle {f^{-1}}(x)=\int {\frac {1}{f'({f^{-1}}(x))}}\,{dx}+C.

} This is only useful if the integral exists.

In particular we need f ′ ( x ) {\displaystyle f'(x)} to be non-zero across the range of integration.

It follows that a function that has a continuous derivative has an inverse in a neighbourhood of every point where the derivative is non-zero.

This need not be true if the derivative is not continuous.

Another very interesting and useful property is the following: ∫ f − 1 ( x ) d x = x f − 1 ( x ) − F ( f − 1 ( x ) ) + C {\displaystyle \int f^{-1}(x)\,{dx}=xf^{-1}(x)-F(f^{-1}(x))+C} Where F {\displaystyle F} denotes the antiderivative of f {\displaystyle f}.

The inverse of the derivative of f(x) is also of interest, as it is used in showing the convexity of the Legendre transform.

Let z = f ′ ( x ) {\displaystyle z=f'(x)} then we have, assuming f ″ ( x ) ≠ 0 {\displaystyle f''(x)\neq 0} : d ( f ′ ) − 1 ( z ) d z = 1 f ″ ( x ) {\displaystyle {\frac {d(f')^{-1}(z)}{dz}}={\frac {1}{f''(x)}}} This can be shown using the previous notation y = f ( x ) {\displaystyle y=f(x)}.

Then we have: f ′ ( x ) = d y d x = d y d z d z d x = d y d z f ″ ( x ) ⇒ d y d z = f ′ ( x ) f ″ ( x ) {\displaystyle f'(x)={\frac {dy}{dx}}={\frac {dy}{dz}}{\frac {dz}{dx}}={\frac {dy}{dz}}f''(x)\Rightarrow {\frac {dy}{dz}}={\frac {f'(x)}{f''(x)}}} Therefore: d ( f ′ ) − 1 ( z ) d z = d x d z = d y d z d x d y = f ′ ( x ) f ″ ( x ) 1 f ′ ( x ) = 1 f ″ ( x ) {\displaystyle {\frac {d(f')^{-1}(z)}{dz}}={\frac {dx}{dz}}={\frac {dy}{dz}}{\frac {dx}{dy}}={\frac {f'(x)}{f''(x)}}{\frac {1}{f'(x)}}={\frac {1}{f''(x)}}} By induction, we can generalize this result for any integer n ≥ 1 {\displaystyle n\geq 1} , with z = f ( n ) ( x ) {\displaystyle z=f^{(n)}(x)} , the nth derivative of f(x), and y = f ( n − 1 ) ( x ) {\displaystyle y=f^{(n-1)}(x)} , assuming f ( i ) ( x ) ≠ 0 for 0 < i ≤ n + 1 {\displaystyle f^{(i)}(x)\neq 0{\text{ for }}0<i\leq n+1} : d ( f ( n ) ) − 1 ( z ) d z = 1 f ( n + 1 ) ( x ) {\displaystyle {\frac {d(f^{(n)})^{-1}(z)}{dz}}={\frac {1}{f^{(n+1)}(x)}}} Higher derivatives [ edit ] The chain rule given above is obtained by differentiating the identity f − 1 ( f ( x ) ) = x {\displaystyle f^{-1}(f(x))=x} with respect to x.

One can continue the same process for higher derivatives.

Differentiating the identity twice with respect to x , one obtains d 2 y d x 2 ⋅ d x d y + d d x ( d x d y ) ⋅ ( d y d x ) = 0 , {\displaystyle {\frac {d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}}\,\cdot \,{\frac {dx}{dy}}+{\frac {d}{dx}}\left({\frac {dx}{dy}}\right)\,\cdot \,\left({\frac {dy}{dx}}\right)=0,} that is simplified further by the chain rule as d 2 y d x 2 ⋅ d x d y + d 2 x d y 2 ⋅ ( d y d x ) 2 = 0.

{\displaystyle {\frac {d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}}\,\cdot \,{\frac {dx}{dy}}+{\frac {d^{2}x}{dy^{2}}}\,\cdot \,\left({\frac {dy}{dx}}\right)^{2}=0.

} Replacing the first derivative, using the identity obtained earlier, we get d 2 y d x 2 = − d 2 x d y 2 ⋅ ( d y d x ) 3.

{\displaystyle {\frac {d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}}=-{\frac {d^{2}x}{dy^{2}}}\,\cdot \,\left({\frac {dy}{dx}}\right)^{3}.

} Similarly for the third derivative: d 3 y d x 3 = − d 3 x d y 3 ⋅ ( d y d x ) 4 − 3 d 2 x d y 2 ⋅ d 2 y d x 2 ⋅ ( d y d x ) 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {d^{3}y}{dx^{3}}}=-{\frac {d^{3}x}{dy^{3}}}\,\cdot \,\left({\frac {dy}{dx}}\right)^{4}-3{\frac {d^{2}x}{dy^{2}}}\,\cdot \,{\frac {d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}}\,\cdot \,\left({\frac {dy}{dx}}\right)^{2}} or using the formula for the second derivative, d 3 y d x 3 = − d 3 x d y 3 ⋅ ( d y d x ) 4 + 3 ( d 2 x d y 2 ) 2 ⋅ ( d y d x ) 5 {\displaystyle {\frac {d^{3}y}{dx^{3}}}=-{\frac {d^{3}x}{dy^{3}}}\,\cdot \,\left({\frac {dy}{dx}}\right)^{4}+3\left({\frac {d^{2}x}{dy^{2}}}\right)^{2}\,\cdot \,\left({\frac {dy}{dx}}\right)^{5}} These formulas are generalized by the Faà di Bruno's formula.

These formulas can also be written using Lagrange's notation.

If f and g are inverses, then g ″ ( x ) = − f ″ ( g ( x ) ) [ f ′ ( g ( x ) ) ] 3 {\displaystyle g''(x)={\frac {-f''(g(x))}{[f'(g(x))]^{3}}}} Example [ edit ] y = e x {\displaystyle y=e^{x}} has the inverse x = ln ⁡ y {\displaystyle x=\ln y}.

Using the formula for the second derivative of the inverse function, d y d x = d 2 y d x 2 = e x = y ; ( d y d x ) 3 = y 3 ; {\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}={\frac {d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}}=e^{x}=y{\mbox{ }}{\mbox{ }}{\mbox{ }}{\mbox{ }};{\mbox{ }}{\mbox{ }}{\mbox{ }}{\mbox{ }}\left({\frac {dy}{dx}}\right)^{3}=y^{3};} so that d 2 x d y 2 ⋅ y 3 + y = 0 ; d 2 x d y 2 = − 1 y 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {d^{2}x}{dy^{2}}}\,\cdot \,y^{3}+y=0{\mbox{ }}{\mbox{ }}{\mbox{ }}{\mbox{ }};{\mbox{ }}{\mbox{ }}{\mbox{ }}{\mbox{ }}{\frac {d^{2}x}{dy^{2}}}=-{\frac {1}{y^{2}}}} , which agrees with the direct calculation.
