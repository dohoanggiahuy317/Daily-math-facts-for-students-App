It is not part of the encyclopedia and contains non-article pages , or groups articles by status rather than subject.

Do not include this category in content categories.

This is a hidden category.

It is not shown on its member pages, unless the corresponding user preference (Appearance ‚Üí Show hidden categories) is set.

This category contains pages which have been semi-protected from editing indefinitely.

Semi-protection prevents anonymous and newly registered users from editing; contributing accounts must be at least 4 days old and must have made at least 10 edits to non-protected pages (including deleted ones).

Use {{ Pp-semi-indef }} to add pages to this category.

This should only be done if the page is in fact semi-protected ‚Äì adding the template does not in itself protect the page.
