[1] [2] Given a hyperreal number x in R ∗ , the monad of x is the set monad ( x ) = { y ∈ R ∗ ∣ x − y is infinitesimal }.

{\displaystyle {\text{monad}}(x)=\{y\in \mathbb {R} ^{*}\mid x-y{\text{ is infinitesimal}}\}.

} If x is finite (limited), the unique real number in the monad of x is called the standard part of x.
