Elementary rules of differentiation [ edit ] Unless otherwise stated, all functions are functions of real numbers ( R ) that return real values; although more generally, the formulae below apply wherever they are well defined [1] [2] — including the case of complex numbers ( C ).

[3] Constant term rule [ edit ] For any value of c {\displaystyle c} , where c ∈ R {\displaystyle c\in \mathbb {R} } , if f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(x)} is the constant function given by f ( x ) = c {\displaystyle f(x)=c} , then d f d x = 0 {\displaystyle {\frac {df}{dx}}=0}.

[4] Proof [ edit ] Let c ∈ R {\displaystyle c\in \mathbb {R} } and f ( x ) = c {\displaystyle f(x)=c}.

By the definition of the derivative, f ′ ( x ) = lim h → 0 f ( x + h ) − f ( x ) h = lim h → 0 ( c ) − ( c ) h = lim h → 0 0 h = lim h → 0 0 = 0 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}f'(x)&=\lim _{h\to 0}{\frac {f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}}\\&=\lim _{h\to 0}{\frac {(c)-(c)}{h}}\\&=\lim _{h\to 0}{\frac {0}{h}}\\&=\lim _{h\to 0}0\\&=0\end{aligned}}} This shows that the derivative of any constant function is 0.

Intuitive (geometric) explanation [ edit ] The derivative of the function at a point is the slope of the line tangent to the curve at the point.

Slope of the constant function is zero, because the tangent line to the constant function is horizontal and its angle is zero.

In other words, the value of the constant function, y, will not change as the value of x increases or decreases.

At each point, the derivative is the slope of a line that is tangent to the curve at that point.

Note: the derivative at point A is positive where green and dash–dot, negative where red and dashed, and zero where black and solid.

Differentiation is linear [ edit ] Main article: Linearity of differentiation For any functions f {\displaystyle f} and g {\displaystyle g} and any real numbers a {\displaystyle a} and b {\displaystyle b} , the derivative of the function h ( x ) = a f ( x ) + b g ( x ) {\displaystyle h(x)=af(x)+bg(x)} with respect to x {\displaystyle x} is: h ′ ( x ) = a f ′ ( x ) + b g ′ ( x ).

{\displaystyle h'(x)=af'(x)+bg'(x).

} In Leibniz's notation this is written as: d ( a f + b g ) d x = a d f d x + b d g d x.

{\displaystyle {\frac {d(af+bg)}{dx}}=a{\frac {df}{dx}}+b{\frac {dg}{dx}}.

} Special cases include: The constant factor rule ( a f ) ′ = a f ′ {\displaystyle (af)'=af'} The sum rule ( f + g ) ′ = f ′ + g ′ {\displaystyle (f+g)'=f'+g'} The difference rule ( f − g ) ′ = f ′ − g ′.

{\displaystyle (f-g)'=f'-g'.

} The product rule [ edit ] Main article: Product rule For the functions f {\displaystyle f} and g {\displaystyle g} , the derivative of the function h ( x ) = f ( x ) g ( x ) {\displaystyle h(x)=f(x)g(x)} with respect to x {\displaystyle x} is h ′ ( x ) = ( f g ) ′ ( x ) = f ′ ( x ) g ( x ) + f ( x ) g ′ ( x ).

{\displaystyle h'(x)=(fg)'(x)=f'(x)g(x)+f(x)g'(x).

} In Leibniz's notation this is written d ( f g ) d x = g d f d x + f d g d x.

{\displaystyle {\frac {d(fg)}{dx}}=g{\frac {df}{dx}}+f{\frac {dg}{dx}}.

} The chain rule [ edit ] Main article: Chain rule The derivative of the function h ( x ) = f ( g ( x ) ) {\displaystyle h(x)=f(g(x))} is h ′ ( x ) = f ′ ( g ( x ) ) ⋅ g ′ ( x ).

{\displaystyle h'(x)=f'(g(x))\cdot g'(x).

} In Leibniz's notation, this is written as: d d x h ( x ) = d d z f ( z ) | z = g ( x ) ⋅ d d x g ( x ) , {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}h(x)=\left.

{\frac {d}{dz}}f(z)\right|_{z=g(x)}\cdot {\frac {d}{dx}}g(x),} often abridged to d h ( x ) d x = d f ( g ( x ) ) d g ( x ) ⋅ d g ( x ) d x.

{\displaystyle {\frac {dh(x)}{dx}}={\frac {df(g(x))}{dg(x)}}\cdot {\frac {dg(x)}{dx}}.

} Focusing on the notion of maps, and the differential being a map D {\displaystyle {\text{D}}} , this is written in a more concise way as: [ D ( f ∘ g ) ] x = [ D f ] g ( x ) ⋅ [ D g ] x.

{\displaystyle [{\text{D}}(f\circ g)]_{x}=[{\text{D}}f]_{g(x)}\cdot [{\text{D}}g]_{x}\,.

} The inverse function rule [ edit ] Main article: Inverse function rule If the function f has an inverse function g , meaning that g ( f ( x ) ) = x {\displaystyle g(f(x))=x} and f ( g ( y ) ) = y , {\displaystyle f(g(y))=y,} then g ′ = 1 f ′ ∘ g.

{\displaystyle g'={\frac {1}{f'\circ g}}.

} In Leibniz notation, this is written as d x d y = 1 d y d x.

{\displaystyle {\frac {dx}{dy}}={\frac {1}{\frac {dy}{dx}}}.

} Power laws, polynomials, quotients, and reciprocals [ edit ] The polynomial or elementary power rule [ edit ] Main article: Power rule If f ( x ) = x r {\displaystyle f(x)=x^{r}} , for any real number r ≠ 0 , {\displaystyle r\neq 0,} then f ′ ( x ) = r x r − 1.

{\displaystyle f'(x)=rx^{r-1}.

} When r = 1 , {\displaystyle r=1,} this becomes the special case that if f ( x ) = x , {\displaystyle f(x)=x,} then f ′ ( x ) = 1.

{\displaystyle f'(x)=1.

} Combining the power rule with the sum and constant multiple rules permits the computation of the derivative of any polynomial.

The reciprocal rule [ edit ] Main article: Reciprocal rule The derivative of h ( x ) = 1 f ( x ) {\displaystyle h(x)={\frac {1}{f(x)}}} for any (nonvanishing) function f is: h ′ ( x ) = − f ′ ( x ) ( f ( x ) ) 2 {\displaystyle h'(x)=-{\frac {f'(x)}{(f(x))^{2}}}} wherever f is non-zero.

In Leibniz's notation, this is written d ( 1 / f ) d x = − 1 f 2 d f d x.

{\displaystyle {\frac {d(1/f)}{dx}}=-{\frac {1}{f^{2}}}{\frac {df}{dx}}.

} The reciprocal rule can be derived either from the quotient rule, or from the combination of power rule and chain rule.

The quotient rule [ edit ] Main article: Quotient rule If f and g are functions, then: ( f g ) ′ = f ′ g − g ′ f g 2 {\displaystyle \left({\frac {f}{g}}\right)'={\frac {f'g-g'f}{g^{2}}}\quad } wherever g is nonzero.

This can be derived from the product rule and the reciprocal rule.

Generalized power rule [ edit ] Main article: Power rule The elementary power rule generalizes considerably.

The most general power rule is the functional power rule : for any functions f and g , ( f g ) ′ = ( e g ln ⁡ f ) ′ = f g ( f ′ g f + g ′ ln ⁡ f ) , {\displaystyle (f^{g})'=\left(e^{g\ln f}\right)'=f^{g}\left(f'{g \over f}+g'\ln f\right),\quad } wherever both sides are well defined.

Special cases If f ( x ) = x a {\textstyle f(x)=x^{a}\!} , then f ′ ( x ) = a x a − 1 {\textstyle f'(x)=ax^{a-1}} when a is any non-zero real number and x is positive.

The reciprocal rule may be derived as the special case where g ( x ) = − 1 {\textstyle g(x)=-1\!}.

Derivatives of exponential and logarithmic functions [ edit ] d d x ( c a x ) = a c a x ln ⁡ c , c > 0 {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}\left(c^{ax}\right)={ac^{ax}\ln c},\qquad c>0} the equation above is true for all c , but the derivative for c < 0 {\textstyle c<0} yields a complex number.

d d x ( e a x ) = a e a x {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}\left(e^{ax}\right)=ae^{ax}} d d x ( log c ⁡ x ) = 1 x ln ⁡ c , c > 1 {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}\left(\log _{c}x\right)={1 \over x\ln c},\qquad c>1} the equation above is also true for all c , but yields a complex number if c < 0 {\textstyle c<0\!}.

d d x ( ln ⁡ x ) = 1 x , x > 0.

{\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}\left(\ln x\right)={1 \over x},\qquad x>0.

} d d x ( ln ⁡ | x | ) = 1 x , x ≠ 0.

{\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}\left(\ln |x|\right)={1 \over x},\qquad x\neq 0.

} d d x ( W ( x ) ) = 1 x + e W ( x ) , x > − 1 e.

{\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}\left(W(x)\right)={1 \over {x+e^{W(x)}}},\qquad x>-{1 \over e}.

\qquad } where W ( x ) {\displaystyle W(x)} is the Lambert W function d d x ( x x ) = x x ( 1 + ln ⁡ x ).

{\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}\left(x^{x}\right)=x^{x}(1+\ln x).

} d d x ( f ( x ) g ( x ) ) = g ( x ) f ( x ) g ( x ) − 1 d f d x + f ( x ) g ( x ) ln ⁡ ( f ( x ) ) d g d x , if f ( x ) > 0 , and if d f d x and d g d x exist.

{\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}\left(f(x)^{g(x)}\right)=g(x)f(x)^{g(x)-1}{\frac {df}{dx}}+f(x)^{g(x)}\ln {(f(x))}{\frac {dg}{dx}},\qquad {\text{if }}f(x)>0,{\text{ and if }}{\frac {df}{dx}}{\text{ and }}{\frac {dg}{dx}}{\text{ exist.

=x_{n}=x},{\text{ if }}f_{i<n}(x)>0{\text{ and }}} d f i d x exists.

{\displaystyle {\frac {df_{i}}{dx}}{\text{ exists.

}}} Logarithmic derivatives [ edit ] The logarithmic derivative is another way of stating the rule for differentiating the logarithm of a function (using the chain rule): ( ln ⁡ f ) ′ = f ′ f {\displaystyle (\ln f)'={\frac {f'}{f}}\quad } wherever f is positive.

Logarithmic differentiation is a technique which uses logarithms and its differentiation rules to simplify certain expressions before actually applying the derivative.

[ citation needed ] Logarithms can be used to remove exponents, convert products into sums, and convert division into subtraction — each of which may lead to a simplified expression for taking derivatives.

Derivatives of trigonometric functions [ edit ] Main article: Differentiation of trigonometric functions d d x sin ⁡ x = cos ⁡ x {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}\sin x=\cos x} d d x arcsin ⁡ x = 1 1 − x 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}\arcsin x={\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-x^{2}}}}} d d x cos ⁡ x = − sin ⁡ x {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}\cos x=-\sin x} d d x arccos ⁡ x = − 1 1 − x 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}\arccos x=-{\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-x^{2}}}}} d d x tan ⁡ x = sec 2 ⁡ x = 1 cos 2 ⁡ x = 1 + tan 2 ⁡ x {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}\tan x=\sec ^{2}x={\frac {1}{\cos ^{2}x}}=1+\tan ^{2}x} d d x arctan ⁡ x = 1 1 + x 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}\arctan x={\frac {1}{1+x^{2}}}} d d x csc ⁡ x = − csc ⁡ x cot ⁡ x {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}\csc x=-\csc {x}\cot {x}} d d x arccsc ⁡ x = − 1 | x | x 2 − 1 {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}\operatorname {arccsc} x=-{\frac {1}{|x|{\sqrt {x^{2}-1}}}}} d d x sec ⁡ x = sec ⁡ x tan ⁡ x {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}\sec x=\sec {x}\tan {x}} d d x arcsec ⁡ x = 1 | x | x 2 − 1 {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}\operatorname {arcsec} x={\frac {1}{|x|{\sqrt {x^{2}-1}}}}} d d x cot ⁡ x = − csc 2 ⁡ x = − 1 sin 2 ⁡ x = − 1 − cot 2 ⁡ x {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}\cot x=-\csc ^{2}x=-{\frac {1}{\sin ^{2}x}}=-1-\cot ^{2}x} d d x arccot ⁡ x = − 1 1 + x 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}\operatorname {arccot} x=-{1 \over 1+x^{2}}} The derivatives in the table above are for when the range of the inverse secant is [ 0 , π ] {\displaystyle [0,\pi ]\!} and when the range of the inverse cosecant is [ − π 2 , π 2 ].

{\displaystyle \left[-{\frac {\pi }{2}},{\frac {\pi }{2}}\right].

} It is common to additionally define an inverse tangent function with two arguments , arctan ⁡ ( y , x ).

{\displaystyle \arctan(y,x).

} Its value lies in the range [ − π , π ] {\displaystyle [-\pi ,\pi ]} and reflects the quadrant of the point ( x , y ).

{\displaystyle (x,y).

} For the first and fourth quadrant (i.

e.

x > 0 {\displaystyle x>0} ) one has arctan ⁡ ( y , x > 0 ) = arctan ⁡ ( y / x ).

{\displaystyle \arctan(y,x>0)=\arctan(y/x).

} Its partial derivatives are ∂ arctan ⁡ ( y , x ) ∂ y = x x 2 + y 2 and ∂ arctan ⁡ ( y , x ) ∂ x = − y x 2 + y 2.

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \arctan(y,x)}{\partial y}}={\frac {x}{x^{2}+y^{2}}}\qquad {\text{and}}\qquad {\frac {\partial \arctan(y,x)}{\partial x}}={\frac {-y}{x^{2}+y^{2}}}.

Then for x 0 ≤ x ≤ x 1 {\displaystyle \,x_{0}\leq x\leq x_{1}} : F ′ ( x ) = f ( x , b ( x ) ) b ′ ( x ) − f ( x , a ( x ) ) a ′ ( x ) + ∫ a ( x ) b ( x ) ∂ ∂ x f ( x , t ) d t.

{\displaystyle F'(x)=f(x,b(x))\,b'(x)-f(x,a(x))\,a'(x)+\int _{a(x)}^{b(x)}{\frac {\partial }{\partial x}}\,f(x,t)\;dt\,.

} This formula is the general form of the Leibniz integral rule and can be derived using the fundamental theorem of calculus.

Derivatives to n th order [ edit ] Some rules exist for computing the n -th derivative of functions, where n is a positive integer.

These include: Faà di Bruno's formula [ edit ] Main article: Faà di Bruno's formula If f and g are n -times differentiable, then d n d x n [ f ( g ( x ) ) ] = n ! ∑ { k m } f ( r ) ( g ( x ) ) ∏ m = 1 n 1 k m ! ( g ( m ) ( x ) ) k m {\displaystyle {\frac {d^{n}}{dx^{n}}}[f(g(x))]=n!\sum _{\{k_{m}\}}f^{(r)}(g(x))\prod _{m=1}^{n}{\frac {1}{k_{m}!}}\left(g^{(m)}(x)\right)^{k_{m}}} where r = ∑ m = 1 n − 1 k m {\textstyle r=\sum _{m=1}^{n-1}k_{m}} and the set { k m } {\displaystyle \{k_{m}\}} consists of all non-negative integer solutions of the Diophantine equation ∑ m = 1 n m k m = n {\textstyle \sum _{m=1}^{n}mk_{m}=n}.
