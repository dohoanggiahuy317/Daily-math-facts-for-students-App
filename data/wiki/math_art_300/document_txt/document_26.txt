[1] [7] By the end of the summit, membership had grown to include over 20 countries, regions and organizations.

[8] Within a month membership had grown to over 50.

[9] Its purpose is to establish a new international norm, or “standard of appropriate behaviour”, that coal should not be burned for power.

[2] In April 2018 a research partnership was announced with Bloomberg Philanthropies.

[10] In October 2018 the South Korean province of South Chungcheong became the first jurisdiction in Asia and the largest user of coal power to join the Alliance.

[11] [12] In December 2018 Sydney , Melbourne , Scotland , Scottish Power , Senegal and Israel also joined [13] and in September 2019 seven new members joined including Germany and Slovakia.

Reaction [ edit ] Reacting to the launch, Tracy Carty of Oxfam said the Alliance "represents real and tangible progress in the fight against climate change.

" [19] Business change organisation The B Team welcomed the Alliance, and argued that exiting coal must happen as a just transition that protects vulnerable workers and communities such as coal mining communities.
