He is also known as an Othello player.

Life [ edit ] He is the son of the physicist Elliot Leader and his first wife Ninon Neményi (his mother was previously married to the poet Endre Kövesi); Darian Leader is his brother.

[1] Imre Lakatos was a family friend and his godfather.

[2] Leader was educated at St Paul's School in London, from 1976 to 1980.

[3] He won a silver medal on the British team at the 1981 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) for pre-undergraduates.

[4] He later acted as the official leader of the British IMO team, taking over from Adam McBride in 1999, to 2001.

[5] [6] [7] He was the IMO's Chief Coordinator and Problems Group Chairman in 2002.

[8] Leader went on to Trinity College, Cambridge , where he graduated B.

A.

in 1984, M.

in 1989, and Ph.

in 1989.

[9] His Ph.

D.

was in mathematics was for work on combinatorics, supervised by Béla Bollobás.

[10] From 1989 to 1996 he was Fellow at Peterhouse, Cambridge , then was Reader at University College London from 1996 to 2000.

He was a lecturer at Cambridge from 2000 to 2002, and Reader there from 2002 to 2005.

[7] In 2000 he became a Fellow of Trinity College.

[11] Awards and honours [ edit ] In 1999 Leader was awarded a Junior Whitehead Prize for his contributions to combinatorics.

Cited results included the proof, with Reinhard Diestel, of the bounded graph conjecture of Rudolf Halin.

[12] [13] Othello [ edit ] Leader in an interview in 2016 stated that he began to play Othello in 1981, with his friend Jeremy Rickard.

[14] In the years from 1982 and 2022 he was 16 times the British Othello champion.

[15] In 1983 he came second in the world individual championship, and in 1988 he played on the British team that won the world team championship.

[16] As of 2024, Leader has won the European Grand Prix Championship six times, most recently in 2023.
