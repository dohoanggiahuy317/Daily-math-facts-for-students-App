Then Δ y = f ′ ( x ) Δ x + ε Δ x {\displaystyle \Delta y=f'(x)\,\Delta x+\varepsilon \,\Delta x} for some infinitesimal ε , where Δ y = f ( x + Δ x ) − f ( x ).

{\displaystyle \Delta y=f(x+\Delta x)-f(x).

} If Δ x ≠ 0 {\textstyle \Delta x\neq 0} then we may write Δ y Δ x = f ′ ( x ) + ε , {\displaystyle {\frac {\Delta y}{\Delta x}}=f'(x)+\varepsilon ,} which implies that Δ y Δ x ≈ f ′ ( x ) {\textstyle {\frac {\Delta y}{\Delta x}}\approx f'(x)} , or in other words that Δ y Δ x {\textstyle {\frac {\Delta y}{\Delta x}}} is infinitely close to f ′ ( x ) {\textstyle f'(x)} , or f ′ ( x ) {\textstyle f'(x)} is the standard part of Δ y Δ x {\textstyle {\frac {\Delta y}{\Delta x}}}.

A similar theorem exists in standard Calculus.

Again assume that y = f ( x ) is differentiable, but now let Δ x be a nonzero standard real number.

Then the same equation Δ y = f ′ ( x ) Δ x + ε Δ x {\displaystyle \Delta y=f'(x)\,\Delta x+\varepsilon \,\Delta x} holds with the same definition of Δ y , but instead of ε being infinitesimal, we have lim Δ x → 0 ε = 0 {\displaystyle \lim _{\Delta x\to 0}\varepsilon =0} (treating x and f as given so that ε is a function of Δ x alone).
